The Third Session of the Preliminary Meeting of the Constituent Assembly of India commenced in the Constitution Hall, New Delhi, at Eleven of the Clock, Mr. President (The Hon'ble Dr. Rajendra Prasad) in the Chair.

PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

3.17.1
President
We are meeting just three months after the last session of the Assembly. In the meantime some important events have happened to which I consider it necessary to make a short reference. Before doing that T have to give to the House the sad news of the death of three of our Members: Raja Maheshwar Dayal Seth from UP, Sir Azizul Haque from Bengal, and Mr. K. L. Mazumdar from Baroda.

3.17.5
President
The death of the last named gentleman has come as a shock because of the tragic circumstances in which it took place. I understand that he was on his way to attend this Session of the Assembly and the railway compartment in which he was traveling caught fire as a result of which he lost his life. I seek the permission of the House to convey to the members of the bereaved families our sympathy with them in their bereavements.

3.17.6
President
I may on behalf of the House be permitted to extend a cordial welcome to the representatives of the States who are Attending this Session and I hope representatives of other States will also be coming soon to assist in the great work which this Assembly has undertaken. I need hardly point out that the tremendous task in which we are engaged requires and expects assistance from all sons and daughters of this country whether they are living in States or in British India and whether they belong to one community or another. The future of the country very largely will depend upon the Constitution which we are able to frame and not only the people of this country but people all over the world are watching our efforts with interest not unmixed with anxiety and it is upto us, to whatever class or community and whatever part of India we belong, to make our contribution towards the accomplishment of this task.

3.17.7
President
News has come from our neighbour and erstwhile partner Burma that a Constituent Assembly has been elected there with objects similar to our own. May I on behalf of the House convey to that august body our greetings and good wishes and our great interest in the accomplishment of the task and the attainment of the object of a free Burma that the people of that country have before them ?

3.17.8
President
Since we met last the British Government have declared their intention to transfer power to Indians by June, 1948. This has naturally added urgency to our work and we must proceed in a business-like way to draw up our Constitution in as short a time as we can. The British Government is pledged to take preparatory measures for transfer of power in advance and while this is being done on one hand, we must be ready with our Constitution well in advance of the date-line to assume responsibility in accordance with the Constitution framed by us. I am, therefore, hoping that the Assembly will proceed with all expedition. There are undoubtedly difficulties which the Assembly will have to face but if we proceed with determination we shall be able to conquer them.

3.17.9
President
It will be recalled that the Assembly appointed several Sub-Committees. The Reports of four of these Committees will, I understand, be placed before the House in due course. I suggest that the Assembly should proceed to appoint Committees to formulate the principles on which the Constitution to be framed will be based and when those principles have been approved the work of drafting the Constitution could be undertaken by a suitable agency and finally the Constitution so drafted could be considered in detail by this Assembly. My suggestion to the Assembly will be that the Sub-Committee for framing the principles should be asked to submit its report in time for consideration by the Assembly some time in June or July and after the report has been considered by the Assembly, the drafting could be done and the Assembly itself could meet in September and finalise the Constitution by the end of October. This is roughly the time-table as the Order of the Business Committee and I envisage it. It is necessary that the Constitution should be finalised as early as possible so that there may be time thereafter for the process of transfer to be completed within the time fixed by the British Government. What I have suggested is tentative as developments are taking place and no one can say for certain what steps the Constituent Assembly may have to take to fulfil its functions. We have already defined our objective and the Constitution that has to be framed will naturally have to conform to it.

3.17.10
President
Whatever the nature of the Constitution that may have to be drafted whether for one undivided India or only for parts of it, we shall see to it that it gives satisfaction to all coming under its jurisdiction. While we have accepted the Cabinet Mission is Statement of 16th May which contemplated a Union of the different Provinces and States within the country, it may be that the Union may not comprise all the Provinces. If that unfortunately comes to pass, we shall have to be content with a constitution, for a part of it. In that case we can and should insist that one principle will apply to all parts of the country and no constitution will be forced upon any unwilling part of it. This may mean not only a division of India but a division of some Provinces. For this we must be prepared and the Assembly may have to draw up a constitution based on such division. Let us not be daunted by the immensity of the task or diverted from our purpose by developments which may take place but go ahead with faith in ourselves and the country which has sent us here. I understand some members would like to say a few words. I request Sir B. L. Mitter to begin.

3.17.11
Sir Brojendra Lal Mitter
Sir, I thank you for the cordial terms in which you have welcomed us, the representatives of the States who are here today. I wish more had come in. I have every hope, however, that at the next Session, few of the States' seats will remain unoccupied. Sir, the Baroda Delegation has suffered a serious loss by the tragic death of one of its members who was on his way to the Constituent Assembly.

3.17.12
Sir Brojendra Lal Mitter
Sir, this Assembly is framing the Constitution of Free India. We, the States, are an integral part of India and we shall share the freedom with British India. We, therefore, want to share the responsibility of framing the Constitution. (Hear, hear)

3.17.13
Sir Brojendra Lal Mitter
We are hereby right of being Indians and not by sufference. We claim that we are in a position to make substantial contribution to the common task. A hundred and fifty years of unitary British rule has resulted in a measure of uniformity in British India, but in the States there is still a great variety. Some States are as advanced as British India, where the people are associated with the administration. Some are absolute monarchies. Some are feudal and some are primitive. All these have to be fitted into the Indian Constitution, because our 93 millions of population are included in the Indian total of 400 millions. We do not want to disturb the main design, as indicated in the first Resolution of this Assembly; but we want to introduce a variety in the pattern so that we may fit into it according to our capacity.

3.17.14
Sir Brojendra Lal Mitter
We want unity in diversity. I appeal to our British Indian colleagues to exercise a little patience with us. We want to march along with them but the pace has to be regulated without impeding the forward move. We are at one with you in that the Indian Union should be strong in the Centre so that India may hold her head high in the comity of nations. We do not believe in isolated independent existence, which can only weaken the Union. We shall join you wholeheartedly in a spirit of co-operation and not in any spirit or securing special privileges at the cost of the Union. We shall endeavour to make the Constitution develop according to the genius and capacity of the different units, so that the development may be natural and healthy.

3.17.15
Sir Brojendra Lal Mitter
Sir, I thank you again.

3.17.16
Sardar K. M. Panikkar
Mr. President, Sir, following what Sir Brojendra Mitter has so very eloquently said, I also, on behalf of the representatives of States who have joined and taken seats today, wish to express our thanks to you, Sir, for the welcome you have extended to us. This was indeed the day to which we have been looking forward. It is a dream which has come true, for at no time in India's history has a representative gathering of people who can speak on behalf of the whole of India met and taken counsel. There have been occasions in the past when sections of India have met. We in the States have also been meeting frequently; but never in the history of India, so far as I can remember, has there been an occasion when representatives from all parts of India have met together in order to decide their future. Therefore, I consider that the taking of seats of certain representatives of Indian States today has a symbolic value which far outweighs the actual number of representatives who have joined, or the insignificance of members who have themselves joined. This is indeed a symbol of the unity to come and from the work that begins today, in co-operation between the representatives of the States and those of the Indian Provinces, we can really hope to look forward to the emergence of a Union of India.

3.17.17
Sardar K. M. Panikkar
Before I proceed to any other matter, I must say a few words of thanks to the work of the Negotiating Committee which made it possible for us to come and sit here. No doubt a Report of that Committee's work will be made to you in a few minutes and it is not for me to say anything about it, but this much I think I might say that, but for the wisdom, courage and vision with which your representatives approached the question of Indian States, it would not have been possible for those of us who desired from the beginning to actively associate themselves with this work to take our place here. Therefore, on behalf of those of us who are here, I must thank the Negotiating Committee for having made this possible. It is true that we represent only a certain number of States. All of us who represent 93 millions in Indian States have not come here today. But one thing I should like to say, that we are by no means an insignificant minority. We, who have come here, represent no less than 20 million people out of 93 million people of Indian States and those who have formally and publicly announced their intention of joining the Constituent Assembly, form more than another 10 to 15 million people, so that actually when we come to think of it, a very substantial portion of the people of Indian States are represented in the Constituent Assembly today.

3.17.18
Sardar K. M. Panikkar
I should like to say one thing here and now, that we are not here by any means as a result of coercion or of any pressure that has been placed upon us. There has been no occasion for any pressure or any force to be used in regard to the States. This is a voluntary association that has been made clear from the very beginning. Any person, however highly placed who declares that our presence here is due to coercion or undue influence, I think, speaks without knowledge of facts. To such precious gentlemen, as would advise us to pause on account of alleged coercion, I have to say clearly and unequivocally that their insinuation is an insult to our intelligence. Are we less patriotic in matters connected with India ? Are we less concerned with the future of India that we have to be coerced to take part in a cause in which it is our right and duty to take part ? Therefore, I want to say firmly here and now, that there has been no coercion and it will not be in the wisdom of things or in the interest of things to talk about coercion of one part by the other.

3.17.19
Sardar K. M. Panikkar
One other point I desire to say. It is not by way of controversy or anything of the, kind. We are not here as a matter of favour. We have a right to be here for the purpose of co-operating in the great task of organising India's freedom. We consider that we have as much right in that matter as any one else. We are indeed asked by some people to wait and see. This is indeed a strange doctrine, because we can only wait and see what happens to others. Are we to wait and see as indifferent observers what happens Ourselves ? That being so, we consider that organising India's freedom as much our duty as it is of others. Looked at from that point of view, where can be no question of our waiting and seeing. We want no favour nor do we want to confer obligations. All that we want is that our problems should be viewed sympathetically by this august body in a sense of friendliness as affecting a large part of India. We, on our part, promise in all humility, to work for the betterment of India and for the Union which we all desire to see established. Sir, I thank you.

3.17.20
Mr. P. Govinda Menon
Mr. President, I am happy in that I have been invited to take part in the deliberations of this historic Assembly. During the last few months, discussions, controversies and negotiations were going on as to whether Indian States should send their representatives to this Assembly; if so, when and how ought they to be selected ? Much of this could have been avoided and the question would have been a most simple one if the question was tackled from the correct perspective, namely, from the perspective of the people of the Indian States.


3.17.21
Mr. P. Govinda Menon
They had never any doubts in the matter. The hundred millions of people of the Indian States never felt nor do they feel now, that they form an entity or group different from their 300 million brothers and sisters living in what is known as British India. For the last 27 years under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and other great leaders, India had been fighting for her independence. In that fight the people of the Indian States have always taken their due share, The people of the States did not feel nor did they take up the attitude that their lot lies elsewhere.

3.17.22
Mr. P. Govinda Menon
Now, after 25 years of war, when the nation sits down to frame the future Constitution we feel that it is our duty and our right to participate in the deliberations therefore. The people of the States. Sir, are one in their desire to participate in the Constituent Assembly.

3.17.23
Mr. P. Govinda Menon
Objections, doubts, questions come not from the people. They come when they do from Dewans, Ministers, Rulers, who by no means, except under the theory of Divine Right, can represent the people. Let me hope, Sir, that before the next Session of the Assembly, all the States would have taken the firm decision to collaborate with all of us and would send their representatives to this House.

3.17.24
Mr. P. Govinda Menon
In the matter of joining this Assembly as in many other matters, the attitude of my State, Cochin has been unequivocal from the very beginning. The people of Cochin, like the people of all other States, wanted from the very beginning to join this Constituent Assembly and desired that their representative or representatives shall be elected. Cochin has been fortunate in that her Ruler has been of the same view. Long before questions of States' representation in this Assembly began to be actively considered, on the 29th July, 1946, the Maharaja of Cochin in a message to the Legislative Council said as follows : "The only other point remaining to be considered is about the Constituent Assembly and the representation of Cochin in it. It has not been settled yet how many representatives Cochin could send to this Assembly However, to set at rest all doubts about the method of representation, I am glad to announce that, after mature consideration, I have decided to allow the people to elect their representative or representatives. This election will be by the Council."

3.17.25
Mr. P. Govinda Menon

The above statement was made at a time when the question of States representation had not begun to be actively considered. No State had then said that it would stand independent and would have nothing to do with the Indian Constituent Assembly. Recently some such statements have been made. Cochin's position remains unchanged even after such attractive doctrines have been dangled before her. Her reaction cannot better be expressed than in the words of the Maharaja himself who, while opening the Aikya Kerala Convention at Trichur the day before yesterday, said as follows :-
"Now let me come to the question of Cochin's relation to the rest of India. This Convention has met here for considering ways and means of establishing United Kerala. The Travancore Government has said that it does not favour this idea and has declared its intention of assuming independence after June, 1948. Its relations with the Central Government are going to be governed by Treaties. You would like to know in these circumstances what Cochin's attitude is in this respect. I have no hesitation to declare that Cochin would continue to remain part of the mother country. It is joining the Constituent Assembly at one. No word or act of mine shall usher in a day when a Cochinite finds, he has lost the right to call himself an Indian."

3.17.26
Mr. P. Govinda Menon
Because we are Indians, Sir, and because we want to share in the destinies of this great country, we have with pleasure and gratefulness accepted your kind invitation to take part in the deliberations of this historic Assembly. Sir, I thank you.

3.17.27
Sir T. Vijayaraghavachariar
Sir, I am glad to find myself in Delhi today. The old saying was that Delhi is at a great distance. I never felt the truth of it until this occasion. Previously I found Delhi so very near but on this occasion I find it has been very far and I am glad I am able to find myself here today, and I am glad that I am here today on a historic occasion. Cold as the winds that blow in December in Simla, and hard as flint like the rocks over which aeroplanes fly over the Baluchistan hills towards the west, must be the heart of the Indian who is not thrilled today at this sight of this Assembly, the Assembly which I feel certain will go down in history down the corridors of time. My feeling is that though we may come from different provinces and different States we are not here on behalf of any particular part of India; we are members of all India and that is quite clear. It is in that spirit that I feel certain that we shall all do our work here, not on behalf of any parochial interests, not on behalf of any narrow sectarian interests but on behalf of the broad interests of the one nation of India. I do not propose to refer to any local problems here; our local problems ought to be solved locally. This place is for all-India problems, and I do hope that all of us will so put our heads together and so do our work that our children and our grand-children and generations yet unborn, will say, "Our fathers and our grand-fathers sat in the year 1947 at Delhi and framed a constitution which has stood the test of time", and on which history will say, "Blessed are these men; they did their work and they laid the foundations rightly, and on those foundations will the future history of India evolve". It is not for us here to take any narrow views; we will take large views, and let us so conduct ourselves that in the future history of India they will say that we did our work properly and that we acquitted ourselves like men, like true sons of India and not true sons of any particular part of India.

3.17.28
Sir T. Vijayaraghavachariar
I thank you, Mr. President, for the very kind words of welcome you have uttered.

3.17.29
Mr. Jainarayan Vyas
Mr. President, on behalf of the people of the States and in their own language, I thank you for the welcome you have accorded to the representatives of the States.

3.17.30
Mr. Jainarayan Vyas
We, the subjects of the States, had some status up to 1933, for in that year the Government of India Bill did refer to us in the expression 'The Princes and their subjects. Unfortunately, after that our existence was ignored. No mention of the States subject was made in the Government of India Act of 1935. When Sir Stafford Cripps came to India we were again forgotten. Nor were we referred to in the Cabinet Mission Proposals. We were placed under such circumstances as would have prevented us from sitting and working in this Assembly with you unless the Princes and their Governments decided to associate us with themselves. It is a pleasure that we are today making history. We are sitting together with (the representatives of) the British Provinces and the representatives of the Rulers (of the Indian States). Had not our Rulers come forward to include us among the States Representatives or had not the Negotiating Committees insisted on our being represented (in the Assembly) it was very likely under the conditions in which we were placed at the time that we would not have been here (in the Constituent Assembly). But it is a pleasure to find that we are here in sufficient numbers with you; and we assure you that we will co-operate with you in all possible ways in making the future Constitution not merely in our self-interest but in that of the whole of India. We consider ourselves as parts of India, although some outsiders had raised walls between us. But these unnatural walls are crumbling today, and we hope that within a short time India would be absolutely one single unit. Once again, I thank you.

3.17.31
Raja Lal Shiva Bahadur
Sir, I join my friends in thanking you for the very cordial welcome you have extended to us. I represent one of the very big States in Central India, and if the Rewa State had not taken the lead, Central India would have gone unrepresented. I hope, Sir, in a very short period my friends in other States and our neighbouring States will definitely decide to join this historic House. The Rewa State will not lag behind in rendering all possible service to the mother country.


3.17.32
Raja Lal Shiva Bahadur
MESSAGE OF GOOD WISHES FROM COORG

3.17.33
President
The Coorg Legislative Council have passed a Resolution which has been communicated to me by the Chief Commissioner, Coorg, for being communicated to this House. I will read it: "That this Council resolves to offer its prayerful wishes to the President and Members of the Constituent Assembly of India for the speedy and successful termination of their efforts to prepare an agreed constitution for India and recommends to the Chief Commissioner that these wishes be conveyed to the President of the Constituent Assembly, New Delhi."

REPORT OF THE STATES COMMITTEE


3.17.34
President
 The next item is the Resolution which will be moved by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.

3.17.35
Jawaharlal Nehru
 Sir, I beg to move:

     "The Constituent Assembly, having taken the report of its States Committee into consideration, resolves that it be recorded. The Assembly welcomes the States representatives who have already been chosen and expresses the hope that other States who have not chosen their representatives will take immediate steps to do so in accordance with the agreed procedure."

3.17.36
Jawaharlal Nehru
I understand that copies of the Report have been circulated to all the Members; I shall not therefore take up the time of the House in reading that Report. That Report is a brief summary of the activities of the Negotiating Committee appointed by this House. We have tried to make it as precise a summary as possible and it shows what took place and what we did, so that the House may be acquainted with the procedure we adopted and all that was said on those occasions. I might add, however, that if it is the wish of the House and if Members desire to see a fuller report of our proceedings, there is a verbatim Report in existence and this Report can be consulted in the Library of the House. I say this because sometimes all manner of rumours get about and people are misled and sometimes people imagine that we are not trying to put all the facts before the public. We have nothing to hide in this matter; indeed we could not possibly do so from this House; and therefore the verbatim Report of everything that was said on the occasions that we met with the Negotiating Committee of the Princes is available for reference to any Member of the House in the Library. It is too long a report for us to have it printed and circulated, nor is it normally desirable to have such reports published in the public press. But there can be no secret as between the Committee of this House and the Members of this House, and therefore, while that document is not meant for publication, I should like to remind the Members, that it is there to be consulted by any Members of this House in the Library.

3.17.37
Jawaharlal Nehru
The House will remember that this Committee was appointed for a specific purpose--for fixing the distribution of seats of the Assembly not exceeding 93, and for fixing the method by which the representatives of the States should be returned to the Assembly. These were the definite directions given to us and we proceeded accordingly, but when we met the negotiating Committee appointed by the Chamber of Princes, other questions were raised. We were confronted by various Resolutions passed by organizations of the Princes. We informed them that we had no authority to deal with any other matter. Our authority was limited to dealing with these two specific matters. Indeed we went a little further. We said we rather doubted the authority even of the Constituent Assembly to deal with all manner of other matters, that is to say, the Constituent Assembly as it is constituted at present. But in any event we were so anxious to get going, so anxious to remove any misapprehensions that might exist, that some of us had further conversations with them and some doubts that they raised were removed in the course of those conversations; some questions that were asked were answered informally, personally if you likes on our behalf because it was not open to us to go beyond the terms of the mandate that you gave us. You will see a reference to that in the Report that is presented to you, in particular because--I am bound to make this point perfectly clear--a few important points were raised by them in the course of those discussions. As it happened, what I said in reply to those questions had more or less been said by me in this House before or by other Members of this House, and therefore, I had no difficulty in saying it to them because otherwise I would have had this great difficulty of saying anything which the House might not approve, or might disapprove as wrong. All of us have certain views in this matter and on one of the occasions when I addressed this House in connection with the Objectives Resolution, I referred also to the States and to the Princes and made it clear that while I, in my individual capacity, held certain views, those views did not come in the way of my stating what the Constituent Assembly stood for, and what its range of activities was going to be. I said then that, while we were deciding in favour of a Republic for the whole of India, that did not bar any State from continuing the monarchical form of Government so far as that State was concerned, provided, of course, that they fitted in the larger picture of freedom and provided, as I hope that there was the same measure of freedom and responsible government in the State. So when these questions were raised. I had no particular difficulty in answering them because in effect they had been mentioned in this House previously.

3.17.38
Jawaharlal Nehru
What were those questions ? First, of course, was--it was an unnecessary question--as to the scope of our work, that is to say, how far we accepted the Cabinet Mission's Statement of May 16, 1946. We have accepted it, and we are functioning in accordance with that Statement. There the matter ends. I do not know what future changes may take place and how these changes might affect our work. Anyhow, we have accepted that Statement in its fullness and we are functioning accordingly.

3.17.39
Jawaharlal Nehru
That leads inevitably to another conclusion, viz., that such subjects, as did not come within the scope of the Union, were subjects to be dealt with by the Units--by the States and the Provinces --and that has been clearly laid down in the Cabinet Mission's Statement. So we said there and we made that clear. What the Union subjects might or might not be is a matter for careful consideration by this House now. But any subjects which did not come within the scope of the Union subjects necessarily are subjects left over to the Units.

3.17.40
Jawaharlal Nehru
Further it was stated that the business of joining the Constituent Assembly or accepting the Scheme or not accepting it was entirely their own. As Mr. Panikkar has pointed out, there was no coercion there can be no coercion either to a State, a Province or to any other part of India, which is participating in this Assembly. There can be no coercion, except, of course, the coercion or compulsion of events and that is certainly a compelling factor and a very big factor which none of us can ignore. So there is no question of compulsion; but at the same time it is true that if certain units or parts of India decide to come in, accepting their responsibilities, they get certain privileges in return, and those who do not come in do not get those privileges as they do not shoulder those responsibilities. That is inevitable. And once that decision has been taken by a Unit, State or other, other consequences inevitably follow, possibly widening the gulf between the two : that is the compulsion of events. Otherwise it is open to any State to do as it chooses in regard to this matter of coming in or not coming in. So that matter has been made clear.

3.17.41
Jawaharlal Nehru
The only other important matter that was raised in this connection was the monarchical form of Government in the States. As I stated in this House previously, in the world today this system of rule by monarchy, whatever good it may have done in the past, is not a system that might be considered to be popular. It is a passing institution : how long it will last I do not know. But in this matter my opinion is of little account. What counts in what this Assembly desires in this matter : what it is going to do : and we have made it clear on a previous occasion that we do not wish to interfere in the internal arrangement of the States. It is for the people of the States to decide what they want and what they do not want. The question, in fact, does not arise in this Assembly. Here we are dealing with Union matters, subjects of fundamental rights and the like. Therefore this question of the monarchical form of Government in the States did not arise here and I told them that so far as we were concerned we were not going to raise that particular subject here.

3.17.42
Jawaharlal Nehru
Lastly, there was the question or rather the misapprehension due to certain words in the Objectives Resolution of this Assembly, where some reference has been made to territorial boundaries being changed. The House will remember that that had no connection with the States as such. That was a provision for future adjustments as they are bound to be Involved. Further it was a provision for suitable units to come into existence, which can be units of this Indian Union. Obviously one cannot have very small units or small fractions of India to form part of the Union. Some arrangement has to be made for the formation of sizable units. Questions arise today and will arise tomorrow even about the division of Provinces. There is very, strong feeling about it. We are discussing today, though for other reasons, about the division of certain Provinces like the Punjab and Bengal. All these have to be considered but this has nothing to do with the provision in the Objectives Resolution. The point has been settled in the Negotiating Committee that any changes in territorial boundaries should be by consent.

3.17.43
Jawaharlal Nehru
Those were the statements I made on behalf of our Negotiating Committee to the other Committee and those statements removed a number of misapprehensions and we proceeded ahead with the consideration of other matters.

3.17.44
Jawaharlal Nehru
Among the other matters was, firstly, the question of the distribution of seats. We decided to refer this matter to the two Secretariats--the Secretariat of the Constituent Assembly and that of the Chamber of Princes. We referred this matter, I think, at 1-30 P.M. one day. Those two Secretariats met, I think, at 3 P.M. the same day and 5 P.M. they arrived at an agreed procedure. That was rather a remarkable thing which is worth remembering. It is true that the rules governing the distribution were to some extent laid down in the Cabinet Mission's Scheme--one seat per million, that is, 93 seats in all. Unfortunately these matters of distribution are difficult and often arouse great controversies and arguments. Nevertheless these two Committees met together and I am very glad that the Secretariat of the Constituent Assembly was helped by the representatives of the States to come to an agreed solution within two hours. That showed that if we approach any of these apparently difficult problems with good will, we find solutions and we find rapid solutions too. I do not mean to say that that solution in regard to the distribution of these seats was a perfect one. Since the agreement was reached certain objections have been raised and criticisms have been made in regard to the grouping of the States here and there. Ultimately we left it to a sub-Committee--a joint Committee of our Negotiating Committee and the States Negotiating Committee--to consider this matter and to make such minor alterations as they thought fit and proper. Now because of these grouping difficulties, a number of States, which might be represented here, are not here. That is to say, the States concerned want to come in and they are quite prepared to do so but the group has not begun to function. Therefore individually they are prevented from coming in. Only yesterday I was informed that one important State, the State of Cutch, was eager and anxious to come in but they formed part of a group of Kathiawar and other States, rightly or wrongly, and till the whole group gets into motion, they do not know how to come in separately. This is a matter to be considered by the sub-Committee. But the point I want to put before the House is this that in this matter as soon as we came to grips with the subject and gave up talking in vague generalities and principles or rights of this group and that group, we came to a decision soon enough and that is a good augury for our work in future, whether it relates to the people of the States or to the rest of India or to any group in India.

3.17.45
Jawaharlal Nehru
We, who meet here, meet under a heavy sense of responsibility--responsibility not only because the task which we have undertaken is a difficult one or because we presume to represent vast numbers of people, but because we are building for the future and we want to make sure that that building has strong foundations, and because, above all, we are meeting at a time when a number of disruptive forces are working in India pulling us this way and that way, and because, inevitably and unfortunately, when such forces are at work, there is a great deal of passion and prejudice in the air and our whole minds may be affected by it. We should not be deflected from that vision of the future which we ought to have, in thinking of the present difficulties. That is a dangerous thing which we have to avoid, because we are not building for; today or tomorrow, we are making or trying to make a much more enduring structure. It is a warning which the House will forgive me, if I repeat--that we must not allow the passion and prejudice of the moment to make us forget what the real and ultimate problems are which we have to solve. We cannot forget the difficulties of the present because that come in our way all the time. We have to deal with the problems of the present, and in dealing with them, it may be, unfortunately that the troubles we have passed through all these years may affect us, but, nevertheless, we have to get on. We have to take quick decisions and final decisions in the sense that We have to act on them. We have to be realists and it is in this spirit of realism, as also in a spirit of idealism, that I say that our Negotiating Committee approached this task.

3.17.46
Jawaharlal Nehru
The House knows that some of the members of the Committee have been intimately associated with the struggle of the peoples of the States for their freedom. The more I have been associated with that struggle, the more I have seen that it cannot be separated from the all-India problem; it cannot be isolated. It is an essential and integral part of the all-India problem, all-India structure, just as the States are an integral part of India. You cannot separate them. And with all my anxiety to further the progress of the peoples of the States with such strength as is in me in my individual or other capacities, when I met the Negotiating Committee I had to subordinate my individual opinions because I had to remember all the time that I was representing this Constituent Assembly. I also had to remember that, above all, we had gone there not to bargain with each other, not to have heated argument with each other, but to achieve results, and to bring those people, even though they might have doubts, into this Assembly, so that they might come here and they might also be influenced by the atmosphere that prevails here. For me it was the solemnity of the task which we had undertaken, and not to talk in terms of results, or individuals or groupings, or assurances. What assurance do we seek from each other ? What assurance is even this House going to give to anybody in India, except the assurance of freedom ? Even that assurance will ultimately depend on the strength and wisdom of the Indian people afterwards. If the people are not strong enough and wise enough to hold together and proceed along the right path, the structure that you have built may be shattered. We can give no assurance to anybody.

3.17.47
Jawaharlal Nehru
With what assurance have we sought freedom for India all these years ? We have looked forward to the time when some of the dreams that we were indulging in might become true. Perhaps, they are coming true, perhaps not exactly in the shape that we want, but, nevertheless, they will come true. It is in that conviction that we have proceeded all these years. We had no guarantees. We had no assurances about ourselves or about our future. Indeed, in the normal course of events the only partial guarantee that most of us had was the guarantee of tears and troubles, and we had plenty of that. It may be that we shall have plenty of that in the future too; we shall face them. This House will face it and the people of India will face it. So, who are we to give guarantees to anybody ? But we do want to remove misapprehensions as far as possible. We do want every Indian to feel that we are going to treat him as an equal and brother. But we also wish him to know that in the future what will count is not so much the crown of gold or of silver or something else, but the crown of freedom, as a citizen of a free country. It may be that a time may come soon when it will be the highest honour and privilege for anybody, whether he is a Ruler or anybody else, to be a free citizen of a free India and to be called by no other appellation or title. We do not guarantee because we guarantee nothing to anybody, but that is the thing which we certainly hope to achieve and we are certain to achieve. We invite them to participate in that. We welcome those Who have come, and we shall welcome those others when they come. And those who will not come--we shall say nothing about them. But, as I said before, inevitably, as things are, the gulf will widen between those who come and those who do not come. They will march along different paths and that will be unfortunate I am convinced that, even so, those paths will meet again, and meet sooner rather than later. But, in any event, there is going to be no compulsion. Those who want to come, will come, and those who do not want to come, do not come. But there is this much to be said. When we talk about people coming in and people who do not come in, let it be remembered, as Mr. Govinda Menon said, that the people of the States--I say with some assurance and with some authority in the matter--want to come into this Assembly, and if others prevent them from coming, it is not the fault of the people, but breaks and barriers are put in their way. However, I hope that these questions will not arise in the future and that in the coming month or two nearly all the States will be represented here, and, jointly we shall participate in the final stages of drawing up the Constitution.

3.17.48
Jawaharlal Nehru
I am placing this Resolution before the House to record the Report. There has been some argument about this matter too and people attach a great deal of importance to words and phrases and assurances and things like that. Is it not good enough that I have put it to the House ? If it is not good enough, I may repeat what has been stated. Even if that is not good enough, what we have stated is there in the verbatim Report of the meetings; we have nothing to add to it, we shall stand by that. We do not go back. But the procedure to be adopted must be a correct procedure. When this Committee was appointed you asked us to report and we have reported. We had got to do something, and we tried to do that and did it. Now, if this matter was to come up for ratification before this House before it could be acted upon, obviously, representatives of the States who are here now would not have been here. They would have been sitting at the doorstep or somewhere outside waiting for ratification, waiting for something to happen till they came in. That was not the way in which we understood our directions. We understood that we had to come to some honourable agreement and act up to it so that representatives of the States might come in as early as possible. We were eager in fact that they should join the Committees of this Assembly,- the Advisory Committee, the Fundamental Rights Committee, the Union Powers Committee and the other Committees which we have formed. It is not our fault that there was delay. At the very first joint meeting of the Negotiating Committees we requested the States Committee to join quickly, indeed to send their representatives to these Committees of the Constituent Assembly as soon as possible. We were asked for assurance at every stage and there were delays. But the way we have understood your mandate was that we had to go ahead and not wait for ratification of every step that we had taken. We acted accordingly, and I am happy that some of the States' representatives are here today and I hope more will come. So the question of ratification does not arise so far as this Committee's work is concerned. The Report is before you. If you disapprove of any single step that we have taken, express your disapproval of whatever might have happened, or otherwise give your directions.

3.17.49
Jawaharlal Nehru
The resolution I have moved is for your adoption. I shall not go into the details in regard to the distribution of the seats and the manner of selection of the delegates from the States. It was a sort of compromise. Naturally it was my desire, as it was the desire of my colleagues that the representative of the States should be elected by the people of the States, partly because it was the right way, and partly because it was the way in which they could be fitted with the other elected elements of this House. On the other hand, I considered it right and desirable that the States governments should also be represented here to bring reality to the picture. The correct way and the right way ultimately will be for the State government itself to be representative of the people and then come in to represent them here. But we have to take things as they are. The States governments, generally speaking, do not represent the people in the democratic sense. In some places they partially represent them. Anyhow, we did consider it desirable that the State governments as such, should also be represented though we would have liked the largest number of representatives to come from the people. Ultimately after a great deal of discussion it was decided that not less than 50 per cent. of the representatives should be elected by the elected members of the assemblies where they exist, or by some other method of election which may be devised. We came to a compromise on this proportion, thought we would have liked the proportion to be higher. Some of the States have actually acted as if the proportion were higher. I submit that this comprise that we came to was an honourable compromise for all parties concerned and I think it will lead to satisfactory results so far as this House is concerned, and I commend the resolution to the House.

3.17.50
President
The motion is: "The Constituent Assembly having taken the report of its States Committee into consideration resolves that it be recorded. The Assembly welcomes the States representatives who have already been chosen and expresses the hope that other States who have not chosen their representatives will take immediate steps to do so in accordance with the agreed procedure."

3.17.51
President
Members who wish to say anything about this motion may now speak.

(At this stage Dr. Kailas Nath Katju approached the rostrum.)


3.17.52
Somnath Lahiri
On a point of information Sir, of the representatives of the States who have come to participate in this House, how many have been elected and how many nominated by the States?

3.17.53
President
The Secretary will give you this information. In the meantime, Dr. Kailas Nath Katju will please proceed with his speech.

3.17.54
K.N. Katju
Mr. President, I ventured to come here for a few minutes and address you on this Resolution because I am connected with one of the States in Central India and also with some in Rajputana; and I have made my home in the United Provinces by adoption. I am, therefore, intensely interested in the endeavour which you are making and I venture to congratulate the Negotiating Committee on the great results that have been achieved.

3.17.55
K.N. Katju
There are a great variety of States, and there are hundreds of them. Some of the States go back and are rooted in the history of our race. Others are of very, recent origin, going back only a century or so and with little of tradition and little of moral authority behind them. I do not wish to pursue this topic at any great length; but I have no doubt in my mind that it is for the good of the States and it is for the good of the people of the States that they should join this great Indian Union of which Pandit Jawaharlal has spoken so eloquently. I have no doubt in my mind that the course of Indian history teaches us that a union of this great country is an inevitability. When I hear of some Provinces or some States or territorial units claiming to be sovereign States or claiming authority for themselves, I wonder whether they have ever considered the drift of Indian history. There is no shadow of doubt in my mind that within the course of the next fifty years, whatever we may do today, or whatever we may say today, the course of events will compel the people to bring about one united Government, one united Centre in India. It is good therefore for the people of the States, it is good for the people of all States, it is good for the Rulers of these States that they should come in and join in this great endeavour. Instead of the Rulers relying upon their so called strength, I think their safety, their integrity and their very existence lies in relying upon the affection, and upon the trust of their own people. If they rely upon that, they may continue, otherwise most of these States will disappear without much regret on the part of their people or on the part of the rest of India. With these words, I commend this Resolution to the care of the House and I should join in the appeal which has been made to every section of the House that in a short time, we will see almost all the States come in and join this Assembly.

3.17.56
President
Mr. Lahiri desires to know when notice of amendments should be given. He complains that notice of this Resolution was received by him last night. I am afraid it is now too late now for him to give notice of amendment.

3.17.57
President
I shall now put the Resolution to the House:

3.17.58
President
The question is:

"The Constituent Assembly having taken the report of its States Committee Into consideration resolve that it be recorded.

The Assembly welcomes the States representatives who have already been chosen and expresses the hope that other States who have not chosen their representatives will take immediate steps to do so in accordance with the agreed procedure."

The motion was adopted.

3.17.59
President
I desire to give the information wanted by Mr. Lahiri. Out of sixteen members representing the States who are attending today, five are nominated and eleven are elected.

ELECTION OF ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO STEERING COMMITTEE

3.17.60
G. Durgabai
Sir, I consider it my proud privilege to be able to stand here today and move the motion which stands in my name. Before I do so, I may be permitted to express my great joy at the presence of the representatives of some of the Indian States who are here today in our midst on this occasion. My heart-felt and sincere thanks are due to those States which have extended their co-operation and joined us in our work.

3.17.61
G. Durgabai
With your leave, Sir, I move: "Resolved that this Assembly do proceed to elect, under sub-rule (2) of Rule 40 of the Constituent Assembly Rules, two additional members to the Steering Committee from among the representatives of the Indian States, in accordance with the principle of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote."

3.17.62
G. Durgabai
Sir, sub-rule (2) of Rule 40 of the Constituent Assembly Rules lays down the procedure for election of members to the Steering Committee. It says : "The Assembly may from time to time elect, in such manner as it may deem appropriate, 8 additional members of whom four shall be reserved for election from among the representatives of the Indian States."

3.17.63
G. Durgabai
Sub-rule (1) of Rule 40 lays down: "A steering committee shall be set up for the duration of the Assembly and shall consist of eleven Members (other than the President) to be elected by the Assembly in accordance with the principle of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote."

3.17.64
G. Durgabai
Sir, I may be permitted to state in this connection that in accordance with these Rulers, eleven members were initially elected top this Committee on 20th January and the Committee has been functioning with these members.  According to sub-rule (2), eight additional members are to be elected from time to time out of whom four are reserved for election from among the representatives of Indian States.  It is considered desirable at present that only two out of four will be elected now and that the election of the two other members shall be postponed to a future date.  We would have been happy had all the four members been elected on this occasion.  But we thought it desirable to elect only two members at present and postpone the election of two other members to a subsequent date.  When we will be fortunate enough to have a much larger representation of Indian States on this Assembly and all present her.  We fondly hoped that some of the leading States like Hyderabad, Travancore, Mysore and some other States would have made up their minds to join us here in our work and co-operate with us.  But I am sadly disappointed to find that they are not able to come and see eye to eye with us and that they are still pursuing a policy of "wait and see". I hope that it will not be before long, that they will follow the noble example set up by States like Baroda, Bikaner, Rewa, Gwalior, Cochin, Udaipur, Jodhpur ans some other States, whose representatives we have here in our midst and send their representatives also to help us in this great task of forging a constitution for this great country.  I extend a hearty welcome to those representatives who will be elected to this Committee, to function on this Committee to help us with their advice and guidance in our work. With these words, I commend this motion for the acceptance of this House.

3.17.65
President
Motion moved: "Resolved that this Assembly do proceed to elect, under sub-rule (2) of Rule 40 of the Constituent Assembly Rules, two additional members to the Steering Committee from among the representatives of the Indian States, in accordance with the principle of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote."

3.17.66
H. V. Kamath
Sir, under sub-rule (2) of Rule 40, four seats have been reserved for election from among the representatives of the Indian States. You have just now been good enough to tell us that today only sixteen representatives are present and seventy-seven are absent. In fairness to the members who are absent, I would suggest that only one seat may be filled today and the other three seats may be filled up later on.

3.17.67
President
The amendment of Mr. Kamath is that in place of two seats, one seat should be filled by election today.

3.17.68
Jawaharlal Nehru
Sir, the Steering Committee has to work from day to day, and if you keep seats vacant for those people who are not here, it is neither good for them nor for the House nor for the Steering Committee. The work of the Steering Committee does not really Involve matters of high principle, but it is very important work and it does affect the business of the House. I think it is not fair that the places of those who do not come here should be kept vacant and we should go on waiting. Of course I do not want anything to be done which might be injurious to their interests, and therefore any important matter can be raised again. Now that we have a chance to take them in, we should do so. It is open to the House to reconsider any matter of vital importance later. At the present moment it is desirable to give full opportunities to those who will come to take part in the business.

3.17.69
H. V. Kamath
Sir, in view of the assurance given by the Hon'ble Pandit Nehru that the number of seats will be increased at a later date I beg to withdraw the amendment.

3.17.70
President
I now put the resolution to vote.
The motion was adopted.

3.17.71
President
Nominations will be received up to 2 P.M. tomorrow and elections, if any, will be held from 4 to 5 P.M. in Room No. 24.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON UNION SUBJECTS

3.17.72
President
Presentation of the Report of the Committee appointed by the Resolution of the Constituent Assembly of the 25th January, 1947, to examine the scope of Union subjects.

3.17.73
B. V. Kamath
Sir, is it only the presentation of the Report or is a motion being moved ? There is no notice of a motion.

3.17.74
President
If the Hon'ble Member will wait and hear, he will know what it is.

3.17.75
N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar
Sir, I come forward to perform a merely routine and prosaic duty of presenting the Report of the Committee on Union subjects. It is not intended that any motion on this Report should be placed before this House today. This Committee was appointed on the 25th January for the purpose of examining the scope and content of the subjects assigned to the Centre in the Statement of the Cabinet Mission of May 16th and to draw up lists of matters included in and interconnected With the subjects so assigned. The Committee started with a strength of twelve and power was reserved to you, Sir, to nominate ten more, the intention being that some seats should be filled by nomination of representatives of the Muslim League if they came in, and others should be assigned to representatives of the Indian States. As it is, the Muslim League has not so far come in, and as Pandit Jawaharlal explained to you a little while ago, strenuous attempts were made to get the full quota of nominations for representatives of the Indian States being filled in, if possible. But it was not possible to do so. In the later stages of our deliberations, however, we have had the assistance of two distinguished representatives from Indian States.

3.17.76
N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar
Now, Sir, I said I was only performing this prosaic duty; I was not going to perform the function which my Hon'ble friend, Mr. Kamath, would have liked me to perform today. Copies of this Report, I believe, have been circulated to Members. It is not, therefore, necessary that I should read the Report; and in connection with mere presentation of reports in a deliberative assembly of this kind it is not usual to make a speech on the contents of such a report except on an occasion such as the one mentioned by Mr. Kamath, for instance, on a motion for taking the Report into consideration. That motion is not to be made today, nor is it intended by those to whom has been entrusted the task of steering the business of this Assembly. It is not their intention that such a motion should be placed before the House during the current Session. There are several reasons why this decision has been taken. In the first place, Sir, the subject is a very important one; it is a vital matter connected with the framing of the Constitution, and it is only desirable that this Report on so important a subject should be read through and studied carefully by Members of this House before it is taken into consideration. And then we have got to remember that the Committee had to work on the Cabinet Mission's Plan. That Plan contains some very unusual features, the unusualness really resulting from the desire to satisfy the wishes of the Muslim League if it ever decided to come in. The coming in of the Muslim League is not yet officially ruled out; there is still a possibility of their coming in, though the probability is perhaps very small. Should this possibility materialise it would be only just and reasonable that the debate on so important a subject, as the subjects and powers to be assigned to the Union centre, should be held in a House which contains a full representation of the Muslim League. Whether they will come in or not will by definitely known before the June-July Session of this Assembly. And that is one main reason why we are not taking up the discussion of this matter in this current Session.

3.17.77
N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar
Then, Sir, there are the Indian States--a number of representatives of Indian States have joined us today but there is a very large number still to come in. Those have not come in because they require time for going through the procedure prescribed for the purpose of choosing them and sending them to this Assembly. The Indian States have got a very vital interest in the matter which is covered by the Report of this Committee, and it is desirable that as full a representation of the Indian States as possible should be in the Assembly before we begin to discuss so important a matter. Thirdly, Sir, there is the question of the present political conversations. The decisions on those conversations are not available yet: they will be available in all probability before we meet again in the June-July Session. The decisions will be of the most important character, and I think the House will agree with me in thinking that those decisions will have very important repercussions on the plan of work which this Constituent Assembly will have to adopt in framing the Constitution for the country if that decision should, as it is feared, take the shape of anything like the division of India into two or more independent States it may become necessary for this Assembly to deviate from rigid conformity to the Cabinet Mission's Plan. It is unnecessary for me to say now in what directions this deviation might become necessary. The nature of those deviations must necessarily depend upon the political decisions that are taken but apart from such deviations the number of subjects that have to be assigned to the Centre, their scope and content, the definition of a field of concurrent jurisdiction between the Union and the Units, and the relations between the Union and the Units as regards the exercise of legislative and administrative powers, will all be matters which would require a fresh and thorough examination. This examination will so far as I can visualize have to be done in close collaboration between the Committee on Union Subjects and the two Committees which are proposed to be set up in the course of the current Session--one for the purpose of determining the principles of the Union Constitution, and the other for determining the principles of a model provincial constitution. These three Committees will have to work in close collaboration, and it is necessary that before they enter into such collaboration, they must have before them the political decisions that will have been reached before them.

3.17.78
N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar
Now, Sir, taking all these facts into consideration, it is, I think, very necessary that the debate on the Report of the Committee on Union Subjects should be postponed beyond this Session, to the next Session, and therefore it is that I am not placing before you any motion for taking this Report into consideration today.

3.17.79
N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar
There is one matter about which I think I must ask the permission of the House to approve of what this Committee has done. In the original Resolution appointing this Committee, it was asked to submit its Report before the 15th of April. As a matter of fact, the Committee signed its Report on the 17th of April. I do hope, Sir, that the House will excuse this delay of two days.

3.17.80
N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar
There is another matter which I might mention. This Report should not be taken as the final Report of the Committee on Union Subjects. I have already placed before you considerations which will necessitate the matter being reviewed and overhauled by the same Committee in collaboration with other Committees. There are matters, for instance, connected with Indian States, which require perhaps more consideration than it was possible to give them during the time that this Committee met between its appointment and today. The representatives of the States who wish to give us the benefit of their views feel that there are some matters which require further investigation before they could finally commit themselves, and there are also other matters and certain questions connected with the subjects which have been listed in this Report about which greater consideration, it is considered by certain members of the Committee, would be necessary. And apart from that there is looming before us the political decision which will necessitate our overhauling the entire Report if it comes to that, Therefore, Sir, I request the permission of the House to let this Committee submit a further Report if it becomes necessary. With these words, I merely present the Report of the Committee to the House.

3.17.81
President
The Report has been presented. I think the House will condone two days delay in signing it, and will also give permission to the Committee to submit another Report if it finds it necessary to do so.

This was unanimously agreed to.

3.17.82
R. K. Sidhva
When the subsequent Report is presented, may I know whether this Report will also be open to discussion. We have not read even a single sentence of this Report which has been presented to the House.

3.17.83
President
We are not entering into any discussion on this Report. The Hon'ble Member will read this Report, and we can then discuss it during the next Session.

3.17.84
President
We will meet at 8-30 tomorrow morning and we will go on until 12-30 when we will adjourn. Any Member who has any amendments to suggest to the Report of the Fundamental Rights Committee should do, so before 5 o'clock this evening. The Report will be taken into consideration tomorrow. The House now stands adjourned until 8-30 A.M. tomorrow.

The Assembly then adjourned till half past Eight of the Clock, on Tuesday, the 29th April, 1947.

The Constituent Assembly of India met in the Constitution Hall, New Delhi, at half past Eight of the Clock, Mr. President (The Hon'ble Dr. Rajendra Prasad) in the Chair.

EXTENSION OF TIME LIMIT FOR THE REPORT OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE


3.18.1
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, I move: "That the Constituent Assembly do extend the time fixed for the presentation of the report of the Advisory Committee appointed by the resolution of the Assembly of the 24th January, 1947 until such date or dates as the President may choose in his discretion."

3.18.2
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
The House is aware that when this Resolution was passed we were required to submit an interim report on Fundamental Rights within six weeks, an interim report on Minorities Rights within ten weeks and our final report within three months from the date of our appointment. We have tried our best to adhere to this time table, but regret that it has not been possible for us to carry it out. At our first meeting held on the 27th February, 1947, we decided unanimously to request you to extend the time limit for the submission of the reports in anticipation of the sanction of the Assembly.

3.18.3
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
We are fully conscious of the necessity of completing our work with the utmost dispatch, but we fear it is not possible to work to a rigid time table. We request therefore that the Assembly may be moved to extend the time limit to such date or dates as you may choose in your discretion.

3.18.4
President
The question is: "That the Constituent Assembly do extend the time fixed for the presentation of the report of the Advisory Committee appointed by the resolution of the Assembly of the 24th January, 1947 until such date or dates as the President may choose in his discretion."

The motion was adopted.

INTERIM REPORT ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS


3.18.5
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, I move: "That the Constituent Assembly do proceed to take into consideration the interim report on the subject of Fundamental Rights submitted by the Advisory Committee appointed by the resolution of the Assembly of the 24th January, 1947."

3.18.6
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, this is a preliminary report or an interim report, because the Committee when it sat down to consider the question of fixing the fundamental rights and its incorporation in the Constitution, came to the conclusion, firstly, that the fundamental rights should be divided into parts--the first part justiciable and the other part non-justiciable. Even while considering the first part it came to the conclusion that we could not come to a final decision as to what fundamental rights are to be incorporated in the Constitution. Considering all the circumstances that exist today and that may arise within the course of the consideration of the various Committees' reports and the drafting of the Constitution, points may arise for suggesting additional fundamental rights and also for making minor alterations or suggestions that may be considered advisable. This report is a draft report. I may also suggest for the consideration of the House that in considering the various clauses that have been recommended by the Advisory Committee, the House may not strictly consider the wording of each clause of the rights suggested. Certain changes may be required while actually legally drafting the clauses, and it would be better to leave the drafting to the Drafting Committee which will make such changes as may be necessary to put them in proper phraseology. What I would submit to the House to do today is generally to accept the principles of each of the clauses that have been suggested for consideration, so that we may not have to devote more time in considering the technical legal details of the phraseology to be adopted.

3.18.7
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
We have now suggested for the consideration of the House those rights that are justiciable. The second chapter we have ourselves not been able to consider. The Fundamental Rights Sub-Committee met and considered this matter for a fortnight and devoted considerable labour and time. After that, the Report was passed on to the Minorities Rights Sub-Committee. That Committee also sat over this Report and anxiously considered various clauses and made certain changes and those changes were adopted. They sat for three days, and then this report was again placed before the Advisory Committee for its consideration. The Advisory Committee sat for two days and at their two sittings they considered the whole thing over again--so, the House will see that this is not a haphazard Report, it has been considered in all its various aspects. It is quite possible to make suggestions, alterations and additions and move amendments, but the House may not have that time which the Committees had, I would humbly submit to the House carefully to consider the various clauses that have been suggested, and when amendments are put forward before the House, they will also be carefully scrutinised. There are about 150 amendments, I hear and scrutiny of the amendments will take some time. The Office has been able to scrutinise about 25 or 30 amendments and that will perhaps take the whole of today's meeting. I move that the Report be taken into consideration, and if that motion is adopted, then we can go and consider the rights clause by clause.

3.18.8
President
Motion moved: "Resolved that the Constituent Assembly do proceed to take into consideration the interim report on the subject of Fundamental Rights submitted by the Advisory Committee appointed by the resolution of the Assembly of the 24th January, 1947."

3.18.9
Hirday Nath Kunzru
Mr. President, the Report before us purports to deal with only those fundamental rights that are enforceable by the courts, but a close study of it shows that it refers to matters which cannot be included under the head "Fundamental Rights", and that it deals with those fundamental rights which are not justiciable. To give an instance, Sir, if a matter which does not fall under the category of fundamental rights, I shall refer to clause 10 which makes "trade, commerce and intercourse among the units by and between the citizens" absolutely free.

3.18.10
L. Krishnaswami Bharathi
On a point of order, Sir. I should like to know whether Pandit Hirday Nath Kunzru is opposing the motion or supporting it. He objects to a particular clause, but this is not the time for it. I should like to know whether he is supporting the motion, for consideration or opposing it.

President
If you just allow the Hon'ble Member to complete his speech, you will be able to know whether he is supporting the motion or opposing it.

3.18.12
Hirday Nath Kunzru
This is the stage at which according to the rules followed by the Legislatures, general observations can be made, and I hope I am strictly in order in dealing with the Report generally. It is not necessary for me to say whether I agree to the main provisions of the Report, or whether I want it to be rejected as a whole. All that I can be fairly called upon to do at this stage is to state my point of view and to ask the House to be careful in dealing with some important matters which are included in this Report.

3.18.13
Hirday Nath Kunzru
Sir, to illustrate my first point, I refer to clause 10 of the Report which deals with what may roughly be called freedom of inter-State commerce. It may be a very desirable thing in itself, probably everyone here will want that trade between the different Units of the Indian Union should be absolutely free, but I doubt whether a clause like this can be included among fundamental rights. Clause 10 deals with a matter which impinges directly on the rights of the Provinces. You may deal with it when you come to settle the powers of the Union and the Provinces; but I submit that you cannot take so important a matter outside the purview of the Committee that will consider the Union and the Provincial Constitutions by calling the freedom of inter-State commerce a fundamental right.

3.18.14
Hirday Nath Kunzru
Again, Sir, it is stated in one of the provisos to this clause that nothing in this section shall prevent any Unit from imposing on goods imported from other Units the same duties and taxes to which the goods produced in the Unit are subjected by them. Now, I should like this to be clearly explained. If there is to be absolute freedom of commerce and trade between the different units, how can any unit be allowed to tax the goods of.....

3.18.15
Frank Anthony
On a point of order, Sir. Can all of us make our respective comments on the provisions of the Fundamental Rights at this stage?

3.18.16
Hirday Nath Kunzru
Sir, Mr. Anthony is a Member of the Central Assembly and he knows very well that in making general observations, say, on a Bill, one can refer to a few clauses to illustrate one's point of view. I am astonished that he should get up and object to my observations, which are of a general character, though he may think that they refer to matters of detail. I am sure that on many occasions he has exercised in the Central Assembly the right which I am exercising here now.

3.18.17
Hirday Nath Kunzru
Sir, there are other examples of this kind that I could give; but I do not think that I need do so in order to illustrate what I have in mind. Now, I will give an illustration or two to show where matters which can hardly be called justiciable have been included in the Report. Clause 8 deals with certain familiar fundamental rights; the freedom of speech, the right to assemble peaceably and without arms and the right to form associations. But they have all been made subject to certain safeguards, which, generally speaking, have been considered necessary in every country. But it is well known, Sir, that these safeguards practically make the rights that I have just mentioned non-justiciable. You may confer general rights on the citizens of India, but if they are to be surrounded with the restrictions mentioned here, and I submit that they will have to be surrounded with some such restrictions--then the right will in practice cease to be justiciable. They will be no more than directive principles of a policy, and there seems to me to be no advantage in considering such matters at this stage when, according to Mr. Patel, we should be considering only those rights that are, strictly speaking, enforceable by the courts.

3.18.18
Hirday Nath Kunzru
I shall give another instance, Sir, in order to make my point of view still clear. I refer, Sir, to clause 8, sub-clause (e), which deals with the right of every citizen to reside and settle in any part of the Union, to acquire property and to follow any occupation, trade, business or profession. This is subject to the condition that "provision may be made by law to impose such reasonable restrictions as may be necessary in the public interest including the protection of minority groups and tribes." Now, Sir, it is very desirable, in general, that there should be freedom of movement; but I do not think that we can accept without qualification the right of the people of one province to settle in another province. The Government of the province concerned must be given the power.... (Cries of "We cannot hear, the microphone is not working), Sir, I can make myself heard without the aid of the microphone. I was dealing with clause 8, sub-clause (e). This clause states that every citizen has the right to reside and settle in any part of the Union. My submission is that while freedom of movement in the Union is desirable and essential, the right to reside and settle in any part of the Union cannot be called non-controversial.

3.18.19
President
The microphone is now working.

3.18.20
Hirday Nath Kunzru
Thank you, Sir, but I think I can make myself heard without it. The province, I was saying, must have the right to decide, in view of its resources what the size of its population at any time should be. No Provincial Government can fairly be asked to allow an unlimited influx of immigrants from another province in pursuance of the principle enunciated here. Let us take the case of Assam, to understand this fully. Will anybody force the Government of Assam at the present time to allow an unlimited number of people from any of the neighbouring provinces to enter Assam and settle down there? That Government is faced with an extraordinary difficult problem and clause 8(e) shows a strange disregard of the existing state of things there. I think, Sir, that this right can be conferred only under certain conditions which will have to be clearly defined.

3.18.21
B.R. Ambedkar
I do not wish to interrupt the speaker; but in dealing with clause 8(e), he is rather giving a wrong impression of the whole clause.

3.18.22
B. Pattabhi Sitaramayya
Instead of giving illustrations to make his points clear, he is going into a discussion of the merits.

3.18.23
Hirday Nath Kunzru
As a parliamentarian, Sir, you understand what I am doing. As regards Dr. Ambedkar's objection, I may say--and I am sure you will bear me out,--I read out the entire clause including the proviso.

3.18.24
President
I would request the Member to confine himself to the point which he wants to illustrate and not go into the merits of the proposal.

3.18.25
Hirday Nath Kunzru
I have given only two illustrations so far and this is only the third illustration that I am giving in order to explain clearly to the House what I have in mind. I am not discussing each and every clause. Sir, I have already read out the proviso to clause 8(e) but in order to satisfy Dr. Ambedkar, shall read it out again: "Provision may be made by law to impose such reasonable restrictions as may be necessary in the public interest including the protection of minority groups and tribes."

3.18.26
Hirday Nath Kunzru
Probably Dr. Ambedkar's contention is that this phraseology is such as to enable a province to decide whether it would allow people coming from outside to reside and settle down within its jurisdiction. If so, a special interpretation will have to be placed on these words. Again, if the proviso is so wide as Dr. Ambedkar contends it is, then the right conferred by clause 8(e) virtually ceases to be a justiciable right.

3.18.27
Hirday Nath Kunzru
Sir, I think I have said enough in order to indicate my point of view. I need not therefore labour the point further, but, before I sit down, I may say again that there seems to be no particular advantage in considering many provisions of this Report at the present time. They can be considered along with the other fundamental rights which have yet to be dealt with by the Fundamental Rights Sub-committee. But if the House wants to proceed with the consideration of this Report, it will have to take special care to see that only those matters are included in it which are really justiciable.

3.18.28
Promatha Ranjan Thakur
Sir, this is a list of fundamental rights which are only justiciable. I do not understand why economic fundamental rights should not be included in these justiciable rights. Economic rights are essential while framing a country's constitution and they must also be made justiciable. I do not understand why mines, key industries and basic industries should not be nationalised. Moreover, this list of fundamental rights should have been considered in the light of reports of the Minorities Sub-committee. The Minorities Sub-committee sat only for two days and they could not go into details as regards safeguards required for minority communities. You know that Minority Sub-committee's Report is very much connected with the list of fundamental rights.

3.18.29
Promatha Ranjan Thakur
Another point to which I wish to refer is in relation to clause 6--regarding 'untouchability' where it is said that- "Untouchability in any form is abolished and the imposition of any disability on that account shall be an offence."

3.18.30
Promatha Ranjan Thakur
I do not understand how you can abolish untouchability without abolishing the very caste system. Untouchability is nothing but the symptom of the disease, namely, the caste system. It exists as a matter of caste system. I do not understand how this, in its present form, can be allowed to stand in the list of fundamental rights. I think the House should consider this point seriously. Unless we can do away with the caste system altogether there is no use tinkering with the problem of untouchability superficially. I have nothing more to say. I hope the House will consider my suggestion seriously.

3.18.31
President
I take it that the Hon'ble Member does not wish to move his amendment.

3.18.32
Promatha Ranjan Thakur
I do not move my amendment.

3.18.33
Somnath Lahiri
I agree with what Pandit Kunzru suggested because it is rather difficult to make a fine distinction between what are justiciable rights and what are not. For instance, when we make a provision that people should have the right to work, that is, unemployment should not be allowed to exist in our country, it would be a social right. If you make it an inalienable provision of our fundamental rights, naturally it will have to be justiciable. Similarly, take the question of nationalisation of land. If we want to say that land belongs to the people and to nobody else, that would be a social and fundamental right no doubt. But, nevertheless, it will also be a justiciable right, if that is to be given effect to. Therefore, it is rather arbitrary to make any fine distinction between what are justiciable rights and what are social and economic rights. Therefore, we would be in a better position to consider the whole thing if the full Report was forthcoming so that we might know what is in it. Otherwise, there is the danger that when we might put certain things as essential, we would be told that social and economic rights will come up not now but later on. Therefore, I support Pandit Kunzru's suggestion for taking all these things together. I do not see any great hurry for getting these few fundamental rights passed just now. I was surprised to read this Report submitted by the Committee. Before this Report was submitted by the Committee, I got a circular from the Congress Party section of the Constituent Assembly enumerating certain rights. Many good points were contained in them. Afterwards, when we received this Report, we find that many of the good points which were mentioned in that circular have been omitted. Let me put it a little more strongly. I feel that many of these fundamental rights have been framed from the point of view of a police constable and many such provisions have been incorporated. Why? Because you will find that very minimum rights have been conceded and those too very grudgingly and these so-called rights are almost invariably followed by a proviso. Almost every article is followed by a proviso which takes away the right almost completely, because everywhere it is stated that in case of grave emergency these rights will be taken away. Now, Sir, what constitutes a 'grave emergency' God alone knows. It will depend on the executive obtaining at a particular period of government. So, naturally anything that the party in power or the executive may not like would be considered a grave emergency and the very meagre fundamental rights which are conceded in this resolution will be whittled down. Therefore, it is necessary for us to see the whole thing together and see what people are going to get. I should like to mention one or two things as examples. What should be our conception of fundamental rights? Apart from the knowledge that we can gather from the experience of other countries, there is also the knowledge born out of our own experience, that is, there are certain rights which we have been denied in the past by an alien and autocratic government. We have come up against those difficulties. We want to incorporate every one of those rights which our people want to get. One vital thing which our people have been suffering from in the past has been the curtailment of the liberty of the press by means of securities and by other methods. The press has been crushed completely. This is a thing against which every patriotic Indian is up in arms, including every congressman, and, therefore, in his heart of hearts every Indian feels that in a free India in order that people may feel freedom and act up to it, there should not be such drastic curtailment of liberties of the press. But what do we find? There is not even a mention of the liberty of the press in this whole list of fundamental rights submitted by the Committee, except a solitary mention made at one place that there will be liberty of expression. Sir, this is something which goes against our experience and must be protected.

3.18.34
Somnath Lahiri
Similarly, there is another thing that we have found all along that a Government which does not depend on the people and which rules the country by autocracy and by means of force, detains people without trial, without having to go through a judicial process. This is a thing against which Indians have been entertaining the bitterest feelings and they have been agitating against this from the Congress and every other platform. But in the fundamental rights that have been cooked up by this Committee we do not find this right. That is why I am constrained to say that these are fundamental rights from a police constable's point of view and not from the point of view of a free and fighting nation. Here whatever right is given is taken away by a proviso. Does Sardar Patel want even more powers than the British Government an alien Government, an autocratic Government which is against the people--needs to protect itself? Certainly not. Sardar Patel has the support of the overwhelming masses of the people and, therefore, he can do with much less powers to rule the country than an autocratic government would require. But here we find that none of the existing provisions of the powers of the executive has been done away with; rather in some respects those powers are sought to be increased. And if some of the amendments are passed--specially that of Sri Rajagopalachariar-- it will in certain cases be even worse than the conditions obtaining at present. I will give one example. Here according to Patel a seditious speech is a punishable crime. If I say at any time in the future, or the Socialist Party says, that the Government in power is despicable, Sardar Patel, if he is in power at that time, will be able to put the Socialist Party people and myself in jail, though, as far as I know, even in England a speech, however seditious it may be, is never considered a crime unless an overt act is done. These are the fundamental bases of the, fundamental rights of a free country, but here a seditious speech also is going to be an offence; and Sri Rajagopalachariar wants to go further. Sardar Patel would punish us if we make a speech, but Rajaji would punish us even before we have made the speech. He wants to prevent the making of the speech itself if in his great wisdom he thinks that the fellow is going to make a seditious speech.

3.18.35
B. Pattabhi Sitaramayya
Sir, we cannot anticipate amendments.

3.18.36
Somnath Lahiri
I will not discuss any more of the amendments.

3.18.37
Somnath Lahiri
We thus find that the feeling among Congressmen in general, as evidenced by this circular of the Constituent Assembly section of the Congress Party, is for extended fundamental and civic rights which will enable the country to function in a free manner and for political oppositions to grow. What is the necessity of fundamental rights in a bourgeois national democracy which you are trying to have? There one of the fundamental objects is that a political opposition must have full freedom to express its views, to draw its own conclusions and to say anything it likes. If I am in the opposition or if someone else is in the opposition it is certainly his business to say that the existing Government is despicable; otherwise he would not be in the opposition. Why should my right to say that be curtailed and at the same time we should assume that political opposition will grow and democracy will develop? It cannot; it will have to depend on the sweet will and the tender mercies of the party in power or the executive in power. That is not the basis of democracy.

3.18.38
Somnath Lahiri
Sir, I would request the Committee to consider the amendments very liberally and try their best to accommodate the amendments so that we can have really good and democratic fundamental rights which will give our people a real feeling of freedom and from which our country will go on gathering strength. Otherwise, if we lay down fundamental rights and then insert provisions in every clause for taking away those rights, we will simply make ourselves a laughing stock before the whole democratic world.

3.18.39
R. K. Sidhva
Sir, I will deal with Mr. Lahiri's statement first. He has misinformed the House by stating that the Committee has absolutely ignored the economic rights and the fundamental rights in various aspects. Sardar Patel in moving his motion made it clear that this is only a preliminary report or rather an interim report; the motion regarding economic and political rights is not here and will be taken up hereafter. Mr. Lahiri must know that we are not unmindful about this matter. We are much more keen on these economic and political rights of the citizens than he imagines; and therefore to say that those rights should have been presented to us now in this document and that failing that we would be making a laughing-stock of ourselves to the world is not fair to this House.

3.18.40
R. K. Sidhva
Now, coming to Dr. Kunzru, I was really very sorry to find him stating that some of the clauses in this statement do not come within the purview of fundamental rights or justiciable rights. If anyone has studied the various constitutions of other countries he will find that there are chapters and chapters and clauses and clauses dealing with economic, commercial and trading rights of the people. And for Dr. Kunzru to state that this is not a fundamental right or a justiciable right is not fair to this House. I will quote a few paragraphs from some constitutions to show that commerce and trade and economics are considered justiciable fundamental rights. In Germany, Part 2 of Art. 138 says : "Property and other rights of unions in respect of a property devoted for public purposes, social and commercial, are guaranteed."

3.18.41
R. K. Sidhva
Then in Art. 151 it says: "Freedom of trade and industry is guaranteed in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the Reich."

3.18.42
R. K. Sidhva
A number of these may be quoted but I will content myself with just a few. Art. 156 says: "The Reich may by legislation in case of present necessity and in the economic interest of the community oblige economic undertakings and associations lo combine in a self-governing basis for the purpose of ensuring the co-operation of all productive factors of the nation, associating employers and employees in the management and regulating the production, manufacture, distribution, consumption, prices and the import and export of commodities upon principles determined by the economic interests of the community."

3.18.43
R. K. Sidhva
Then further take South Africa. Section 136 says: "There shall be free trade throughout the Union, but until Parliament otherwise. provides the duties of customs and of excise leviable under the laws existing in any of the colonies at the establishment of the Union shall remain in, force."

3.18.44
R. K. Sidhva
Clause 10 and clause 8, to which Dr. Kunzru has made reference, refer to trade within the Units and the Union, and I see no reason why such a clause should not stand for the protection of the various trades that would move about from Unit to Unit and from Unit to Union. As regards clause 8(e) it says: "The right of every citizen to reside and settle in any part of the Union, to acquire property and to follow any occupation, trade, business or profession.”

3.18.45
R. K. Sidhva
It is considered a justiciable and fundamental right. If a right to reside and settle is not a justiciable or fundamental right, I do not know what else it could be. Under the circumstances I do feel that the objections of Dr. Kunzru are untenable and I agree with Mr. Lahiri that in some respects this Report is certainly not complete, and we have to give elaborate personal and political rights. It is not that we have ignored that part. There are various amendments on the order paper; I have moved some of them and other Hon'ble Members have also done so. They will be considered by this House. I might also state that the Committee had suggested that the secrecy of correspondence should be guaranteed and that there should be no kind of interception of correspondence, telegrams and telephones, but the main Committee has deleted it. Therefore, it is unfair to say that the Fundamental Rights Committee did not consider this question. We have now moved amendments to that effect, and it is for the House to consider those amendments. Mr. Lahiri should not have made all those general remarks; he should have confined himself to the amendments which have been moved. Therefore, I contend, Sir, that these fundamental rights are justiciable, and I do feel that the objection of Dr. Kunzru is not justifiable and that Mr. Lahiri, in his anxiety to move more amendments to protect the rights of every citizen, made an uncalled for remark that we will be making this country a laughing-stock of the world. This is too much indeed.

3.18.46
N. G. Ranga
I wish to congratulate this Committee on having produced this very valuable document and presented it to this House.

3.18.47
N. G. Ranga
I think it is not worthy of any member of this House to describe this as a sort of cooked-up document from a responsible Committee like this. But I am not surprised that this remark, unworthy as it is, has fallen from the lips of one of our members, considering the political history of the member as well as the antecedents of his party.

3.18.48
President
Please do not make any personal remarks.

3.18.49
N. G. Ranga
I have said enough about it.

3.18.50
N. G. Ranga
We are told that this document is prepared from the view point of a policeman. I do not know where the policeman comes in except by way of our attempt to keep him out of the exercise of our fundamental rights. That is exactly the main object with which this charter of Fundamental Rights has been prepared. We have had such a bitter experience of policemen in this country that the authors of this document have had to formulate these clauses in such a way as to have the least possible interference of policemen. If there are any provisions, they are intended to see that those people who believe in liberalism at one end and communism at the other will not be enabled to take advantage of these rights to pave the way for totalitarianism. It happened like that in several States of Europe between the two wars. They took advantage of the fundamental rights there to the extent that they came to power and paved the way for Nazism on the one hand and for communism on the other. We want to safeguard ourselves against such a menace. We have had this experience before us and it is the duty of any responsible body like this to make provision for such provisos as will enable a democratic parliament in this country to prevent any mischief-monger--organized or unorganized--from demoralizing our own democratic State to such an extent as to pave the way and effectively achieve a totalitarian State in this country.

3.18.51
N. G. Ranga
A reference has been made to the absence of any reference in this particular document to freedom of the press. But if a little care had been exercised, it would have been found that this has been provided for in the very first clause--sub-clause 8(a): "The right of every citizen to freedom of speech and expression." Expression' includes freedom of the press.

3.18.52
N. G. Ranga
Now come to the other point--where is the provision for the functioning of the opposition party in these fundamental rights, we are asked? To draw your attention to a very small thing I need only say that the Congress Party itself is such a democratic body as to make it possible for people like Rajaji to give notice of one set of amendments and people like so many us to give notice of other amendments which may be diametrically opposite to them, and yet we are able to digest these, consider them all and come to an agreeable decision, a decision which will be democratic and which may come to be acceptable to all parties in the House. We have to make it possible for various political parties to function in our country; we all agree on that. It does not come to us as a sort of a new thought from abroad or from other country, but what I wish to remind this House as well as the member concerned is this: in that country which is upheld as a sort of an ideal to us all, where is there any scope for the opposition party? Is there any scope for the opposition party at all? Indeed in Soviet Russia, people are not allowed to organize themselves into free trade unions. Here in in this country we are already enjoying these rights and we are epitomizing them in this great document. Look at it from every point of view and you will find that this document proposes to give to our masses in this country more democratic, more liberal, more comprehensive, and more fundamental rights than are being enjoyed in any other country, not even excluding Soviet Russia.

3.18.53
N. G. Ranga
There is another point raised by my Hon'ble friend, Dr. Kunzru, namely that several of these things are not justiciable. I am not a lawyer, and, therefore, I do not wish to go into the technical side of it. All that I say is to express my extreme satisfaction with regard to clause 22(1) and 22(2) wherein the right is given to the ordinary citizen to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of any of the rights guaranteed by this part. This is a very important privilege that is being conferred on our citizens. The only additional privilege that I wanted to be conferred upon them is that--as I said on an earlier occasion--those citizens who are so poor as not to be able to move the Supreme Court, should be enabled under proper safeguards, of course at the cost of the State, to move the Supreme Court in regard to the exercise of any of these fundamental rights. With all these provisos Dr. Kunzru told us that the very essence of these fundamental rights is being lost and Mr. Lahiri has agreed with him. It is rather amusing how Liberalism and Communism can come together and coincide with each other. We have our experience of the way in which the Public Safety Ordinances were enforced in this country. We know that those Ordinances were very arbitrary; they conferred terrible powers, unquestionable powers upon the executive. Are we to be told now that in the same way we should not have any of these provisos at all but that simply power should be conferred upon the Government and that any order made under this particular clause or that particular clause cannot be questioned in a court of law? That is how it is. We were detained and the orders that were passed to detain us could not be questioned at all in any court of law. But in spite of that there were noble judges. Hon'ble judges of the Calcutta High Court and also of the Central Provinces, who had the courage of their conviction, who were able to look in between the words of those very same ordinances as well as the Public Safety Act and were able to save many people from the gallows by setting aside the judgments of the so-called Special Courts. Similarly, it must be possible and it would be possible, when this document becomes a part of our own Constitutional Law. This document has been so carefully drafted as not to give arbitrary powers but to give just as much power as can possibly be digested in the organisational or institutional exercise of his rights by the ordinary citizen in this country, either organisedly or individually--as much power as possible to those people to see that these individuals, these organisations or institutions are given every possible safeguard or protection. Therefore, these provisos are not going to make these rights nugatory at all. These provisos are intended to prevent our democracy being demoralised or degraded into a dictatorship. These rights are intended to protect our citizens, our law-abiding citizens who believe in democracy from those who believe in dictatorship but only pretend to work for the cause of democracy in order to establish their own dictatorship.

3.18.54
B. Pattabhi Sitaramayya
Sir, I now move for closure being applied to the discussion.

3.18.55
President
I think we have had sufficient discussion on the motion. The question is: "That the question be now put." The motion was adopted.

3.18.56
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, when I moved my motion for the consideration of this Report I did not anticipate any long debate on this question. I thought that there would be plenty of opportunities for scrutinising the clauses, omitting some clauses, if necessary, that may be considered objectionable or improving any if need be. Now that the debate has taken place I want to place before the House certain aspects of the proceedings of the Committee which will give the House an idea that this is neither a haphazard Report nor a report cooked or uncooked. It is carefully considered Report. There were two schools of thought in the Committee and there was a large number of very eminent lawyers who could scrutinise every word of every sentence, even commas and semi-colons, from a very critical point of view. These two schools viewed the matter from two different angles. One school considered it advisable to include as many rights as possible in this Report--rights which could straightaway be enforceable in a court of law, rights in regard to which a citizen may without difficulty go straightaway to a court of law and get his rights enforced. The other school of thought considered it advisable to restrict fundamental rights to a few very essential things that may be considered fundamental. Between the two schools there was considerable amount of discussion and finally a mean was drawn which was considered to be a very good mean. It must not be understood, because this Report is called an Interim Report, that the second Report will be much bigger, or that many more important things will come under the subsequent report. It cannot, in the nature of things, be that the principal report which comes before the House would be containing less important things. Very essential things have been included in this Report. But there is another report which has to be considered and that is the report on fundamental rights which are non-justiciable. There may be other points that may strike this House or may be suggested from outside which may have to be considered and the Committee may take them into account. But I may inform the House that this Report has gone through three Committees. Of course the third school of thought was absent in the Committee. That school would require that under the fundamental rights which were provided for a free India there should be no police, there should be no jail, there should be no restrictions on the press, the baton, the lathi or the bullet. Everybody should be free in a free India to do what he likes. That school was absent in the Committee. But the two schools of thought that considered this Report studied not the fundamental rights of one country alone but of almost every country in the World. They studied all the Constitutions of the world and they came to the conclusion that in this Report we should include as far as possible rights which may be considered to be reasonable. On that there may be difference of opinion in this House and this House is entitled to consider every clause from a critical point of view and to suggest alterations, modifications or omissions but what I have moved in this House, now is, that this Report may be taken into consideration. Therefore, I thought that any elaborate speech was not necessary and hence I suggested that whatever has to be considered, or whatever suggestions have to be made, may be made at the time when clauses are considered. As I told the House there are about 150 amendments, though the time given was about ten hours or so. The House contains members who are very studious, very critical and very well-informed and therefore it is to the credit of the House that we have got as much as 150 amendments in such a short space of time. I think if we proceed at this rate we will debate perhaps for a much longer period than we expect. So, I suggest that the Report be taken into consideration, and if that is accepted, we may take clause by clause.

3.18.57
President
The question is: "That the Constituent Assembly do proceed to take into consideration the interim report on the subject of Fundamental Rights submitted by the Advisory Committee appointed by the resolution of the Assembly of the 24th January, 1947."

The motion was adopted.

CLAUSE 1—DEFINITIONS

3.18.58
President
We now proceed to consider the Report clause by clause. Clause 1.

3.18.59
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Clause I is a clause which gives the definition: "Unless the context otherwise requires--
(i) 'The State' includes the legislatures and the governments of the Union and Units and all local or other authorities within the territories of the Union.
(ii) 'The Union' means the Union of India.
(iii)'The law of the Union' includes any law made by the Union legislature and any existing Indian law as in force within the Union or any part thereof."

3.18.60
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
I do not think that this clause requires any speech in support of it. Therefore I formally move this clause for the consideration of the House.

3.18.61
President
I have got notice of several amendments to clause 1. Mr. Kamath.

3.18.62
K.M. Munshi
I have given notice of certain verbal amendments to this clause. I could do this only this morning, and if you will be pleased to give me leave...

3.18.63
Unnamed Members
Louder, please.

3.18.64
K.M. Munshi
I have submitted to the Office certain verbal amendments to clause 1, which I have already presented to you, and I beg leave under our rules to move these amendments. They are not amendments of substance; they merely make some verbal changes. If you will be pleased to give me leave I may also move them.

3.18.65
President
I am afraid I have not seen those amendments. But if they are only verbal amendments, I suppose the House will have no objection to their being moved. But I should like to say that I would not allow substantial amendments to be taken up without due notice. (To Mr. Munshi), I shall take up your amendments a little later, unless they can be covered by Mr. Kamath's or any other amendment.

3.18.66
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Are there any amendments to this clause?

3.18.67
President
I have got notice from two Hon'ble Members.

3.18.68
K.M. Munshi
Before Mr. Kamath moves his amendment, may I say that mine is a verbal amendment to clause 1(i). If that is permitted to be moved, it will remove any doubt that there may be.

3.18.69
President
You can move yours. (To Mr. Munshi).

3.18.70
K.M. Munshi
I beg to move that in clause 1 sub-clause (i), insert the words "for the purpose of this Annexure" between the words "State" and "includes". The reason of this amendment is very clear. In order to have one convenient phrase only for the purpose of this annexure we have to use the word "State ". The word "State" has been used here only for the purpose of verbal convenience and only for the purpose of this Chapter. If it be left as it is, it might lead perhaps to an impression that this is the definition of "State" in the Constitution Act. Therefore, I submit that the words "for the purpose of this Annexure", that is, for the purpose of the preliminary report in this Annexure, be inserted as I have moved above.

3.18.71
Unnamed Member
Then how will the clause read?

3.18.72
President
Clause 1, sub-clause (i) will read thus: "The State' for the purpose of this Annexure includes the legislatures and the governments of the Union, etc., etc."

3.18.73
President
(To Mr. Munshi). In other places the word "Part" is used, and the word can be used in place of "annexure".

3.18.74
K.M. Munshi
I will accept that.

3.18.75
President
Sub-clause (i) will read as follows: "'The State' in this Part includes the legislatures and the governments of the Union, etc., etc."

3.18.76
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
I accept this amendment.

3.18.77
L. Krishnaswami Bharthi
I submit that amendment of Mr. Munshi may appropriately be prefixed to the first sentence itself to cover all the three definitions of that clause. We can say-- "Unless the context otherwise requires, and for the purpose of this Part--" and then give the definitions as in the clause.

3.18.78
President
Instead of putting in-the words "for the purpose of this Part" after the word "State". let those words come in the beginning. Then it will read as follows: "In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires-- (i) 'The State' includes the legislatures and the governments of the Union and the Units and all local or other authorities within the territories of the Union." and so on.

3.18.79
K.M. Munshi
I have no objection, Sir. "Union" must mean the Union of India wherever it is.

3.18.80
K. Santhanam
The amendment is to the definition of "The State" and not to any other definition.

3.18.81
President
Mr. Munshi's amendment as recast by me has been accepted by the Mover. Does the House accept the amendment?

The amendment was adopted.


3.18.82
K.M. Munshi
I have an amendment to clause 1, sub-clause (iii), that is purely verbal. Sub-clause (iii) says: "The law of the Union' includes any law made by the Union legislature and any existing Indian law as in force within the Union any part thereof." I want to delete the word "as" in the phrase "as in force".

3.18.83
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
I accept this amendment.

3.18.84
K.M. Munshi
It was felt by many that if the word 'as' is put in, it would mean something as may be in force. Otherwise the word 'as' should be deleted.

3.18.85
Promatha Ranjan Thakur
Sir, the words "The law of the Union" include any law made by the Union. Sometimes the Union executive may pass orders which have got the force of law. I think the orders made by the Union executive must also be included in this clause.

3.18.86
President
Did you move an amendment?

3.18.87
Promatha Ranjan Thakur
No, it is not an amendment.

3.18.88
President
Mr. Munshi's amendment wants the word 'as' to be omitted and the mover has accepted this amendment. Can I take it that the House accepts this amendment?

The amendment was adopted.


3.18.89
President
Mr. Kamath will please move his amendment.

3.18.90
H. V. Kamath
Mr. President, since I sent in my amendment I have learnt that the terms whose definitions have been incorporated in this clause have been arranged in alphabetical order and I am further told that in the matter of definitions the alphabetical order should and does take precedence over any other order. In these circumstances, I do not desire to move my amendment and beg leave of the House to withdraw the same.

3.18.91
President
Dr. Syama Prasad Mookherjee may move his amendment.

3.18.92
Syama Prasad Mookerjee
Sir, in view of Mr. Munshi's amendment, it is not necessary for me to move my amendment.

3.18.93
President
Mr. Chaudhury may move his amendment.

3.18.94
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
Sir, I beg to move that in clause 1, the following new definitions be inserted:-- "(iv) 'School' means any educational institution."

In these clauses dealing with the fundamental rights, we find the word 'school' and also the words 'educational institutions' being used at different places, leading one to think that some distinction is intended. I would like it to be clearly stated that by school we mean any educational institution. I am referring to clause 18 sub-clause (2) where it is stated--

"No minority whether based on religion, community or language shall be discriminated against in regard to the admission into State educational institutions, nor shall any religious instruction be compulsorily imposed on them."

Here the words used are "State educational institutions". In sub-clause (3) (a) it is laid down--

"All minorities whether based on religion, community or language shall be free in any Unit to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice."

Here we have the words "educational institutions". And in sub-clause (3) (b) the word 'schools' is used--

"The State shall not, while providing State aid to schools, discriminate against schools under the management of minorities whether based on religion, community or language."

This is likely to lead to confusion and my amendment is intended to avoid this confusion.

3.18.95
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
We have to safeguard our rights in the schools also. Some like you, Sir, are extremely good at their studies and knock off all the prizes. But others there are who have other kind of memories of their school days. They remember standing on the bench, standing on the floor, kneeling down on the floor, kneeling under the bench, and all that. We do not want any such things to happen again, because the clauses here are not clear. They should apply equally to schools and to all educational institutions. Therefore, I suggest it may be put down that schools mean any educational institutions.

3.18.96
K.M. Munshi
In clause 18(3)(b) the word "schools" has not been used to narrow down the scope of the clause but to discriminate them from other educational institutions. This question, I think can best be dealt with when we come to clause 18. Actually sub-clause (3)(b) was intended to apply only in regard to the system of primary education.

3.18.97
President
Shall I put the amendment to vote now ? The amendment is--one part of it--
That in clause 1, the following new definitions be inserted:--

'School' means any educational institution.

The amendment was negatived.


3.18.98
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
The second part of my amendment is, for defining untouchability, it may be clearly stated that.

"'Untouchability' means any act committed in exercise of discrimination on, grounds of religion, caste or lawful vocation of life mentioned in clause 4."

Sir, in the fundamental rights, it has been laid down that untouchability in any form should be an offence punishable by law. That being so it is necessary that the offence should be properly defined. As it stands, the word 'untouchability' is very vague. It should be defined in the manner in which I have put it, or in some other better form. which may be decided upon by the House.

3.18.99
S. C. Banerjee
Mr. President, the word 'untouchability' actually requires clarification. We have been accustomed to this word for the last 25 years, still there is a lot of confusion as to what it connotes. Sometimes it means merely taking a glass of water and sometimes it has been used in the sense of admission of 'Harijans' into temples, sometimes it meant inter-caste dinner, sometimes inter-caste marriage. Mahatma Gandhi who is the main exponent of 'untouchability', has used it in various ways and on different occasions with different meanings. So when we are going to use the word 'untouchability', we should be very clear in our mind as to what we really mean by it. What is the real implication of this word? I think we should make no distinction between untouchability and caste distinction, because as Mr. Thakur has said, untouchability is merely a symptom, the root cause is caste distinction and unless and until the root cause, that is caste distinction is removed, untouchability in some form or other is bound to exist and when we are going to have an independent India, we should expect everyone to be enjoying equal social conditions. It is incumbent on us that we should be very clear as to make it explicit that in the future independent India, there should be no distinction between man and man in the social field. In other words, caste distinction must be abolished. Of course there is difficulty as to whether we can make it justiciable or not. I have thought over it for a long time. I do really believe that in place of untouchability, some other word, such as, 'caste distinction' should be used or the word 'untouchability' should be clearly defined so as to leave no doubt in the mind of any one as to what we really mean by it.

3.18.100
K.M. Munshi
Sir, I oppose this amendment. The definition is so, worded that if it is accepted. it will make any discrimination even on the ground of place of birth or 'caste or even sex Untouchability. What does the definition say? "Untouchability' means any act committed in exercise of discrimination on grounds of religion, caste or lawful vocation of life mentioned in clause 4."

3.18.101
K.M. Munshi
Now, Sir, clause 4 does not deal with untouchability at all. It deals with discrimination regarding services and various other things. It may mean discrimination even between touchables and untouchables, between people of one province and another. The word 'untouchability' is mentioned in clause 6. The word 'untouchability' is put purposely within inverted commas in order to indicate that the Union legislature when it defines 'untouchability' will be able to deal with it in the sense in which it is normally understood.

3.18.102
K.M. Munshi
The present amendment will be extending the scope of the definition of untouchability. Sir, I oppose the amendment.

3.18.103
D. N. Datta
Sir, it seems to me that whether the definition suggested by Mr. Rohini Kumar Chaudhury is accepted or not, it is necessary that there should be some definition put in. Here it is said that 'untouchability' in any form is an offence. A magistrate or a judge dealing with offences shall have to look to the definition. One magistrate will consider a particular thing to be untouchability, while another magistrate may hold a different thing to be untouchability, with the result there will be no uniformity on the part of the magistracy in dealing with offences. It will be very difficult for the judge to decide cases. Moreover, untouchability means different things in different areas. In Bengal, untouchability means one thing, while in other provinces, it means an entirely different thing. So, unless a definition is put in, it would be impossible for the judiciary to deal with offences coming under untouchability. Whether you accept the amendment of Mr. Rohini Kumar Chaudhury or not, some definition must be there. This question may be left to the Drafting Committee to find out some suitable definition of the word 'untouchability'. I strongly feel that unless there is a definition it cannot be dealt with as an offence. We all feel that untouchability should be made an offence and it should be done away with. I also feel with my friend Mr. Thakur that the root cause of untouchability, namely, the caste system, in Hindu society should be abolished altogether. Unless the caste system is abolished, untouchability will persist in some form or other. It has been said times without number by our leaders that unless Hindu society is drastically reformed by abolishing the caste system, it is bound to perish. Caste system should be abolished. So, if we are to deal with 'untouchability' as an offence, there should be some definition and I hope it would be left to the Drafting Committee to frame suitable definition so that it will be placed before the House for discussion. With these words, I support the amendment.

3.18.104
President
I should like to draw the attention of the House to clause 24 which says: "The Union Legislature shall make laws to give effect to those provisions of this part which require such legislation and to prescribe punishment for those acts which are declared to be offences in this part and are not already punishable."

3.18.105
President
I take it that the Union legislature will define the word 'untouchability' so that the courts might prescribe proper punishment.

3.18.106
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

The amendment was, by leave of the Assembly, withdrawn.


3.18.107
President
I do not propose to put to vote of the House clause by clause. We will discuss each clause and the House will come to certain decisions. These decisions will be reviewed when the whole Constitution is ready. Suitable alterations will be made in the light of what precedes and what follows, so that there might be no discrepancy between one part and another. Therefore, the House need not be very meticulous about words now.

3.18.108
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
There shall be no duplication of debates and it shall not be open to reopen the whole thing. There shall be only reconciliation between various clauses, in the matter of phraseology.

3.18.109
President
I do not suggest any duplication or any second discussion clause by clause. When the whole draft comes back we shall see how each clause fits and that there is no discrepancy. Subject to that I think the House can take clause by clause into consideration.

3.18.110
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
Sir, on a point of information, I should like to know whether a separate Bill like the Bill of Rights will embody all these provisions and then will be presented to this House. In that case it will be unnecessary to discuss these amendments.

3.18.111
President
We are now discussing that very thing. As I, said, we shall see at the end that all conflicts and discrepancies are removed; not that we shall discuss the whole thing over again.

3.18.112
M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar
Sir, you should put the question that clause 1, as amended, be passed.

3.18.113
President
I am not taking formal votes because it will not then be open to review later on. Therefore, I am taking up the consideration of the clauses one after another.

3.18.114
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, unless it is accepted by the House there is no point in going through, the whole Report. When the whole Report is gone through, it is understood that the necessary adjustments will be made. But if you leave the whole thing open without taking votes there is no point in going through the Report.

3.18.115
N. V. Gadgil
Does a vote mean that it is finally accepted and there is no further scope of any further suggestions even in the matter of principle?

3.18.116
K. Santhanam
Sir, some of the rules may be changed afterwards and you can ask the House to change anything. But let us accept the clauses.

3.18.117
President
It is always open to the House to review its own decisions and in that way every decision that we take today will be open to review. But I was suggesting that even without reopening the whole thing we might remove all conflicts and discrepancies which may appear later on by making the necessary adjustments. In any case I will put clause 1 to vote.

3.18.118
President
The question is that clause 1, as amended, be passed.

The motion was adopted.

CLAUSE 2-APPLICATION OF LAWS


3.18.119
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, I move that clause 2 be accepted. The clause runs thus :
"All existing laws, notifications, regulations, customs or usages in force within the territories of the Union inconsistent with the rights guaranteed under this part of the Constitution shall stand abrogated to the extent of such inconsistency, nor shall the Union or any unit make any law taking away or abridging any such right."

3.18.120
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
If we make a fundamental right justiciable this is not a necessary corollary of it but in this connection I should like to draw the attention of the House to paragraph 7 of the Report which says:
"Clause 2 lays down that all existing laws, regulations, notifications, customs, or usage in force within the territories of the Union inconsistent with the fundamental rights shall stand abrogated to the extent of such inconsistency, while the course of our discussions and proceedings we have kept in view the provisions of existing Statute law, we have not bad sufficient time to examine in detail the effect of this clause on the mass of existing legislation. We recommend that such an examination be undertaken before this clause is finally inserted in the Constitution."

3.18.121
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Therefore, this clause is subject to examination of its effect on the existing laws and this should be done before the Constitution is finally drafted and the clause finally adopted.

3.18.122
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, I move.

3.18.123
K. Santhanam
Sir, I gave notice of an amendment but I will move it in a somewhat modified form in terms of a suggestion made by Sardar Patel. I move that in clause 2 for the words "nor shall the Union or any unit make any law taking away or abridging any such right", the following be substituted:
"Nor shall any such right be taken away or abridged except by an amendment of the constitution."

3.18.124
K. Santhanam
The only reason is that if the clause stands as it is then even by an amendment of the Constitution we shall not be able to change any of these rights if found unsatisfactory or inconvenient. In some constitutions they have provided that some parts of the Constitution may be changed by future constitutional amendments and other parts may not be changed. In order to avoid any such doubts I have moved this amendment and I hope it will be accepted.

3.18.125
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, I accept the amendment.

3.18.126
Promatha Ranjan Thakur
Sir, the words are "nor shall the Union or unit .... etc". "Union" has been defined in the first clause but not "unit". That also should be defined.

3.18.127
President
The word "unit" does not occur in Mr. Santhanam's amendment and so the question does not arise.

3.18.128
Rev. J. J. M. Nichols-Roy
Sir, we understand that there will be provincial constitutions and each province will frame its own constitution. If so, the amendment of any law relating to a province should be left to the provinces instead of to the Union. The power to amend the Provincial law must lie in an autonomous province. If it is true, as we understand now, that the Union will deal with certain subjects only like Defence, External Affairs and Communications, we do not want that any provincial power should be limited by any fundamental right or any of its powers to be taken by the Union of India. Therefore, it seems to me that this amendment will be dangerous. I suggest that we should deal with all the fundamental rights first and take up this clause 2 last. I want to see whether any provision in the fundamental rights, does not encroach on the powers of an autonomous province or State.

3.18.129
B. Das
I am inclined to agree with the Hon'ble Rev. Nichols-Roy, and I cannot accept Mr. Santhanam's amendment. We cannot delegate that power to the Union Legislature or the Provincial Legislature. That means that the future Constituent Assembly be called upon to make such fundamental changes that are implied by the amendment of Mr. Santhanam. I would suggest to the House to see to whom we are delegating this power before we accept this amendment and leave the Provincial Legislature to do anything it likes.

3.18.130
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
The amendment suggested would make all the fundamental rights obligatory because it is absolutely essential that this clause should be passed if these rights are considered justiciable and fundamental. If these are not justiciable then they are not consistent. But if it is considered that those clauses which confer rights on citizens which could be enforced in law, then it is necessary that any act, custom, regulation or notification which takes away or abridges this right, must be abrogated. Otherwise, it is meaningless. Therefore, Sir, I oppose the postponement of the motion. I have of course accepted Mr. Santhanam's amendment.

3.18.131
President
The mover of the Resolution has accepted Mr. Santhanam's amendment. The question now is:
"That in clause 2 for the words 'nor shall the Union or any unit make any law taking away or abridging any such right, the following be substituted: 'nor shall any such right be taken away or abridged except by an amendment of the constitution'."

The motion was adopted.


3.18.132
President
The question is--(I will now read the amended clause)- "All existing laws, notifications, regulations, customs or usages in force within the territories it the Union inconsistent with the rights guaranteed under this part of the constitution shall stand abrogated to the extent of such inconsistence, nor shall any such right be taken away or abridged except by an amendment of the constitution."

3.18.133
President
The Constitution will provide rules for its own amendment, and the Constitution will be amended in accordance with the rules which will be provided in the Constitution. This clause also, if necessary, may be amended in the same way as any other clause in the Constitution.

The motion was adopted.

CLAUSE 3—CITIZENSHIP


3.18.134
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Now I will take up clause 3: "Every person born in the Union or naturalised in the Union according to its laws and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be a citizen of the Union."
To this should be added: "Further provision governing Union citizenship may be made by the laws of the Union."

3.18.135
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
That was originally passed by the Committee but in printing it was omitted by mistake. It will be moved by Mr. Munshi.

3.18.136
K.M. Munshi
These words were originally in the Report which was placed before the Advisory Committee, but it seems due to some oversight they did not find a place in the final Report. The idea is that the Union will not only have to make laws with regard to naturalisation but with regard to citizenship further provisions may also have to be made. So those words have to find a place in this particular clause; otherwise the whole idea will remain incomplete. I therefore move that the following words may be added at the end of this clause: "Further provision governing Union citizenship may be made by the laws of' the Union."

3.18.137
Promatha Ranjan Thakur
The clause as it stands is rather vague. It reads-- "Every person born in the Union or naturalised in the Union according to its laws... "

3.18.138
Promatha Ranjan Thakur
I do not understand how a person can be born according to law. There should be a comma after 'Union'; you must not leave it vague.

3.18.139
B. Das
This clause is the only outstanding fundamental right a citizen can claim--political equality. 'Every person born in the Union..' will include any non-Indian--a German, or a Japanese who will enjoy the rights of Indian citizenship from the 14th to 21st year unless he declares that he is not an Indian. I would like a provision should be made that-- "a person born in the Union can declare for the nationality open to him by virtue of descent."


3.18.140
B. Das
It seems that the Fundamental Rights Committee has not bothered about this aspect of the question.

3.18.141
B. Das
European born sons and daughters will seek occupation in State and private services and later they can turn as aliens. Lord Roberts was born in India and yet he was one of the greatest satraps to keep down Indians. Of course only one European, Pierre Loti, was born in India and he remained a friend of India throughout. I do agree with my leaders as far as they are thinking on the right lines, viz., that they will bring further provisions by legislation to define fundamental rights. It appears to me that the present draft of citizenship is very wrong as it concedes economic exploitation to aliens on some pretext. Nowhere have you defined nationality, as has been suggested by Mr. Sidhwa. We do see that the Fundamental Rights Committee had to race against time and that they had no time to take into consideration certain factors which they have ignored so far. I do hope that this House will look into that aspect of the matter and will not agree to exploitation of Indian citizens in any shape or manner, by aliens or alien-born I feel very unhappy over this lacuna of exploitation.

3.18.142
K.M. Munshi
Sir, on a point of personal explanation I was in error in stating that this clause was omitted by mistake. I looked into the Minutes and I find that it was dropped in the Advisory Committee. I was under a wrong impression.

3.18.143
President
The point that has been raised by Mr. Das deserves consideration and I want the mover to consider it. The wording of the clause as it stands is-- "every person born in the Union shall be a citizen of the Union."

3.18.144
President
Mr. Das says that the wording is too wide and may include the child of any foreigner born in this country, as he would acquire the right of citizenship by the mere fact of his birth.

3.18.145
K.M. Munshi
May I point out that the wording is "subject to jurisdiction"--That is the doctrine of allegiance. Persons born of foreigners, consuls and diplomats, will not be included.

3.18.146
President
"Subject to jurisdiction" will not include allegiance. I am not quite sure about it but the lawyers in this House have to help us on that.

3.18.147
K.M. Munshi
"Subject to jurisdiction" has been defined by several authorities and it means persons born of persons who owe allegiance to the Union. If necessary, I will satisfy the Hon'ble Member who has put forward this point of view. The wording "subject to jurisdiction" has been taken from the American Constitution and has been expressly construed to mean this.

3.18.148
President
Our Constitution should be self-contained as far as possible. We should not depend on the interpretation of clauses in other constitutions, as it may lead us to any amount of confusion.

3.18.149
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
Sir, this clause has been borrowed from the American Constitution. There are two ideas of citizenship. In the Continental countries citizenship is based upon race: it has nothing to do with the birth of a person in any particular place. In the Anglo-American system if a person is born in a particular place, he gets his citizenship. If you want to adopt a different system you may. Under the American system if a Hindu goes to America even today, he becomes an American citizen, though if it is a question of naturalisation there are difficulties in the way of such naturalisation. So the question of birth stands on a different footing from the question of naturalisation. If I may say so, with respect to my friend, Mr. Munshi, that phrase "subject to jurisdiction" is put in for a purpose different from what he stated. Supposing a consul is here and a child is born to him, the child will not get citizenship, because the consul or his child will not be subject to the jurisdiction of the Union. That, is why "subject to jurisdiction" is used here, because a person born to a consul here is supposed to be born in his own country. So far as any ambassador or consul or any other person holding a similar status is concerned, the child will not get the citizenship. That is why the expression "subject to the jurisdiction" occurs in that clause. Therefore the main principle underlying this clause is that if a person is born here be must get the citizenship, even if he is a foreigner. That is the principle obtaining in England -in America and in every other country in which Anglo American jurisprudence prevails.

3.18.150
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
So far as continental countries are concerned citizenship is based upon blood: it is based upon race: and therefore wherever that person may be if he is the son of a person of a race he has to get citizenship. That is the principle. No doubt difficulties have been expressed in regard to this principle of birth, when people leave their country and children are born to them. That is why provision is made in the British Nationalities Act in regard to birth of children to British citizens abroad and an appropriate provision may be made in the Union laws to cover such cases. The first part of the clause commits the Constitution to the fundamental principle that every person who is born in this Union is a citizen of the Union. The second part of it refers to naturalisation and then both of them are subject to the jurisdiction thereof. Other cases where children are born to nationals who go abroad from this country will have to be provided for by the Union law. That is the exact position. This is merely the principle obtaining in the Anglo-American law, viz., that if a person is born within the jurisdiction he shall get the citizenship. If you want to depart from it, it may land you in difficulties. You may borrow the whole of the continental system-- either the German, French or the Italian system of nationality. But we thought that it would be much better to follow the Anglo-American system, a system with which we are acquainted.

3.18.151
President
I want to ask one question. Suppose a Jap by birth is travelling through this country and while travelling a child is born to him. What happens?

3.18.152
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
In spite of the language of the clause the American Supreme Court has held on this very clause that a casual visitor like that will not come within the language of the Constitution.

3.18.153
M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar
Why not?

3.18.154
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
My answer is that the Supreme Court of America construing this particular clause has held that. I think it is a reasonable exception which can be made. I have looked into this particular point yesterday thinking that this point would come up for consideration, because even a lady passenger in a railway train may give birth to a child, and an exception should be made to cover that class of person who is transiently present in this country to whom a child is born, that that person shall not have citizenship. But then what exactly is the meaning of 'transient presence'? That will have to be provided for and it will be very difficult. Under those circumstances there is no great hardship felt in America by adopting the rule that birth determines citizenship. Otherwise you must have a detailed provision as in the British Nationalities Act, where there are four special clauses to cover such cases. You must borrow all the clauses of the British Nationalities Act, which provides a more comprehensive definition than this. But we thought that on the whole it would be better. to adopt the shorter form as in the American Constitution which can find a place in a chapter on Fundamental Rights.

3.18.155
President
It seems to be a very important question and we should thrash it out. What would happen to a man who is not simply passing through the country but stays in this country, say, for some years for trade purposes or some other purpose?

3.18.156
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
His son will become a citizen, but political rights are distinct from civic rights. There is no general rule of law that a citizen is entitled to political rights, because we know as a fact that according to the American law of citizenship the citizen is only entitled to civic rights. It does not stand in the, way of the Constitution being so framed as not to concede political and other rights to the citizen. Citizenship by itself does not carry anything like minimum rights. Citizenship may confer certain rights in particular cases. If you think that those clauses should not be extended to all the citizens, it is for you to make a distinction. Citizen right by itself normally under the American law from which it borrowed--does not connote any minimal rights, Though the Eighteenth Amendment is applicable to every State in U.S.A., the citizen does not possess political and other similar rights in various States in the Union. Certain rights we have extended to all people. So far the area of fundamental rights of citizens has been considerably reduced and no considerable difficulty can possibly arise in regard to citizenship in matters relating to religion, protection of property, protection of person, protection of organisation and some safeguards as to public order and all that. But the difficulty is likely to arise by importing the idea of political rights into citizenship. Otherwise, we must consider the question whether we have to borrow this principle at all or depart from it altogether. We have got that very thing in the British Nationality Act itself. Or we shall, have to have some concept of citizenship distinct from the British Nationality Act, distinct from the American law, borrowing from the German or Italian conception or we must have our own idea of what citizenship is. That is how the matter stands.

3.18.157
President
Personally, I do not like that we should follow the precedent of any other country. We should have our own citizenship and formulate what that citizenship connotes.

3.18.158
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
While I greatly appreciate that, I cannot altogether forget the fact that citizenship will carry with it protection in the international field. In dealing with citizenship we have to remember we are fighting against discrimination and all that against South Africa and other States. It is for you to consider whether our conception of citizenship should be universal, or should be racial or should be secretarian. That is a question of politics on which I am not so competent as some other people here. But so far as this is concerned, I merely state the law as it is and the principles on which the Fundamental Rights Committee has proceeded.

3.18.159
M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar
Take the case of a Japanese who comes into this country and stays here for some time and a son is born to him. Does he lose the citizenship which he inherits from his mother in Japan or he does not do so and he continues to be a citizen of both countries?

3.18.160
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
The problem of double nationality is one of the most difficult questions which international jurists have to face. All that we can provide for is a kind of citizenship. We cannot try to remove all the complications that will arise out of the problem either of statelessness or double nationality. Owing to conflict between the continental and Anglo, Saxon systems differences might arise. You might provide for a particular person choosing his citizenship in cases where such conflict arises, but you cannot possibly provide in a chapter on fundamental rights all the complications that may arise on account of the problem of double citizenship, statelessness and all those considerations.

3.18.161
M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar
In clause 4 it is said: "The State shall make no discrimination against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste or sex."
Therefore, that is an unqualified citizenship and this a fundamental right. This can only be modified by a modification of the Constitution, not even by the law of a unit or of the Union Legislature. Therefore, you are not making a discrimination between citizenship rights and political rights. Is it not desirable that we should not leave this definition in an indefinite form as it now stands in this paper?

3.18.162
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
The clause relating to discrimination in the context can only refer to civic right. It will be for the Provincial and the Union Constitution to give franchise in any form. You can make it subject, if necessary, to qualifications as to franchise both in the Provincial and the Union Constitutions. I may also say that in fact some members of the Committee were anxious to say that every right must be a human right. I hope I am not disclosing any secret when I say that Mr. Masani went to the length of saying that most of the rights should be extended to human beings who are in this country; that was the stand he took up. As a matter of fact, there is nothing novel in that. The first Ten Amendments of the American Constitution are not confined to citizens. Whatever may be the interpretation put upon them by the Supreme Court, the first Ten Amendments of the American Constitution are not confined to citizens. It extends to every human being generally. Of course, the word "discrimination" has been understood not to extend to political right, and it is only confined to civic right ordinarily exercised by the citizen. We are not doing anything novel.

3.18.163
R. V. Dhulekar
I submit there is no provision made for any child which has been born outside the Union of parents who are citizens of the Union. I should like to know whether that child will also obtain the right of citizenship or not?

3.18.164
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
That is why provision has been made that the law of the Union may provide for it.

3.18.165
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
One other suggestion I would like to make. When we draft the Union Constitution you may consider it. If you accept the view, that normally speaking we have to adopt the general principle in Anglo-Saxon or American jurisprudence subject to necessary modifications or modifications that may be, introduced by the Law of the Constitution for the time being, especially in view of what has already fallen from you, we will consider the whole thing in juxtaposition with other provisions of the Constitution, and if it is likely to come into conflict, that may be considered. But one thing, are we going to bring in race idea, namely, only those who are born of parents--you call them Indians or other people--are entitled to citizenship or are you going to subscribe to the principle that birth settles citizenship, though necessary exception will have to be engrafted for the purpose of providing for children of Indian nationals who are born abroad? I am not at all suggesting that you must rigorously follow the principle of what you call lex soli, that is, place of birth? The two principles are lex soli and lex sanguinis. Lex soli means the law of the place of birth arid lex sanguinis means according to blood. These are the two different principles in the field of international law.

3.18.166
R. K. Sidhva
When this question was considered in the main Advisory Committee, the clause read thus: "Every person born in the Union or naturalised in the Union shall be a citizen of the Union."

3.18.167
R. K. Sidhva
I moved an amendment there that the citizenship clause being very vague should be made more clear as you have rightly pointed out. I put a definite period. I said, whoever is not naturalised for at least ten years in this country shall not be considered a citizen.

3.18.168
R. K. Sidhva
On this the following words were added:-- "According to the laws and subject to the jurisdiction there of." I was told that this would cover my point; although I was not satisfied as commonsense man I felt --that this did not cover the view point I raised. I was, however, helpless before the views of the legal luminaries. It is, therefore, very necessary that we should have a clear definition of the word 'citizen', and it should be put down in the Constitution and not left to be dealt with when we are making laws hereafter. I suggest that it should be explicitly defined here, and that this clause be postponed and dealt with tomorrow.

3.18.169
Jagat Narain Lal
Sir, I feel that the definition of citizenship given in the Constitution of the Irish Free State may be useful in this connection. The definition there is-- "Every person, without distinction of sex, domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State at the time of the coming into operation of this Constitution, who was born in Ireland or either of whose parents was born in Ireland or who has been ordinarily resident in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State for not less than seven years, is a citizen of the Irish Free State." I think, Sir, if some such time limit, as seven years for domicile is laid down, that will solve our difficulty.

3.18.170
M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar
Sir, I find that the words in this definition are taken, almost word for word, from the American Constitution. In the American Constitution it reads thus-- "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are the citizens of the United states and of the State wherein they reside."


3.18.171
M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar
But this definition of 1868, we are told, has been given various interpretations during the subsequent years. I would therefore request this matter to be left over for being dealt with tomorrow. It is one of the most important clauses. On the question of citizenship there have been lots of quarrels all over the world, in Jerusalem, for instance. This is a matter on which there is scope of difference of opinion. For example, if a Japanese child is born in this country, should it be allowed to become a citizen of this country or become a national of this country merely because of the fact that it was born here? Or can we lay it down that if a man lives in this land for a period of 10 or 15 years, he should get the right of being a citizen of this country? I do not think we should make any distinction between foreigners in the matter of citizenship in this country. I feel it is not contemplated in the fundamental rights, it is an innovation. These are matters which require deep thought. I would, therefore, suggest leaving this question over till tomorrow when we will sit together and find out how to modify the present definition.

3.18.172
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
Sir, I would only invite the attention of the House to the definition of a British citizen and even this has given rise to difficulties and they have had to make special provision for married women. It is not an easy thing to produce a Nationality Act by tomorrow morning.

The definition says:--

(1) The following persons shall be deemed to be natural born British subjects, namely:-
(a) Any person born within His Majesty's dominion and allegiance; and
(b) Any person born out of His Majesty's dominions whose father was, at the time of that person's birth, a British subject, and who fulfills any of the following conditions, that is to say, if either,
(i) his father was born within His Majesty's allegiance; or
(ii) his father was a person to whom a certificate of naturalisation had been granted; or
(iii) his father had become a British subject by reason of any annexation of territory; or
(iv) his father was at the time of that person's birth in the service of the crown; or
(v) his birth was registered at a British consulate within one year or in special circumstances, etc.
(c) Any person born on board a British ship whether in foreign territorial waters or not.

3.18.173
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
Even this Act had caused difficulty in the case of married women. Therefore, if at least one thing is decided upon and if we generally accept the general principle, that will be better. My friend, Mr. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar is more hopeful than myself. I do not think it will be possible to come with a ready-made solution of this difficulty by tomorrow coming. For the time being, let us accept the general principle. The exact qualifications and modifications necessary may be considered later. We need not overnight manufacture a law of nationality before 11 o'clock tomorrow morning.

3.18.174
President
May I make one suggestion for the consideration of the mover? As it is a very important matter--and it is one to which I myself attach great importance--if an amendment like this could be accepted, it might remove most of our difficulties. You begin the sentence like this: "Save as otherwise provided by the law of the Union, every person born in the Union or naturalised in the Union according to its laws and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be a citizen of the Union."

3.18.175
President
Now, as the clause reads, apart from what the American precedent is, about which I do not know, it seems to me that it is so wide that everyone born in this country will be a citizen of the Union, and the rights of a citizen are specifically given, in clause 9.

3.18.176
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
There are two ideas about nationality in the modern world, one is broad-based nationally and the other is narrow nationality. Now, in South Africa we claim for Indians born there South African nationality. It is not right for us to take a narrow view.

3.18.177
President
We claim for Indians in South Africa the nationality of that country not merely by birth but by reason of settling there.

3.18.178
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Yes. This Constitution is for a period of ten years after which it will be subject to revision. We have added a proviso which covers all our difficulties. I suggest for your consideration how many foreign men and women come to India for giving birth to children to acquire Indian nationality. It is a curious idea that, for that purpose you introduce racial phraseology in our Constitution. It is important to remember that the provision about citizenship will be scrutinised all over the world. They are watching what we are doing. We will be undergoing great risk if you postpone this matter and raise legal controversies. By commenting on every word in this, you will never come to an end. This is a simple problem. We must always have a few foreigners coming here. This will be accidental nationality--If by the accident of birth, someone comes and stays here, subject to the proviso which we have enacted, we can control double citizenship by our legislation. We can always control that.

3.18.179
C. Rajagopalachariar
We must remember that this clause is intended for the positive purpose of creating a unitary citizenship of India. We should not be obsessed by foreign accidental possibilities.

3.18.180
Kailas Nath Katju
Mr. President, it is hardly necessary for me to add to the illuminating exposition of Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar. I suggest that in the definition as it stands we might add something on these lines. Under the present law every person who is born in British India today has Indian citizenship. If a person is born anywhere outside India, then he becomes an Indian subject because he is the son of an Indian subject. That ought to be made quite beyond controversy. That should not be left to the proviso. Wherever the subject of the Indian Union goes to any part of the globe and if a child is born to him there, then that child becomes the subject of the Indian Union. I understand that to be the law. If that is not the law, then it ought to be the law of the Union. We are now sending a number of Ambassadors abroad in order to establish contacts with all foreign countries. It would be lamentable if Indian people who go there and if a child is born to them, then that child should not be treated as an Indian subject. This ought to be added to the definition. I do not wish to say anything about double nationality. The law is quite clear. It was very much stressed during the trials of the Indian National army personnel. It was then found that it sometimes happens that if a child of a non-British subject is born in India, then that child may have double nationality of the country where he is born and of the country of his parents. When he becomes a major, it is open to him to accept one nationality and renounce the other. Speaking for myself, whoever is born on Indian soil should be welcomed as a subject of the Indian Union. That is a plain and intelligible proposition. I think we should accept it.

3.18.181
K.M. Munshi
As has been suggested by Dr. Katju, every child born of Indian parents should have the citizenship of the Union. Now as a matter of fact, the clause as originally sought to be inserted, has this provision that children would he citizens of India, if when they are born the parents are Indian citizens. But it was felt that if you once start introducing various elements and considerations in this clause, then we will be engaged in enacting a nationality law here and now. Therefore the amendment, which I moved, was inserted, viz., that further provisions required for these different cases will be made by a law of the Union. After all we are not making a law of nationality. We are only enacting two indispensable conditions, namely, persons born in India and naturalised according to the law of the Union shall be citizens. The world is divided between the ideas of racial citizenship and democratic citizenship, and therefore, the words 'born in India' become necessary to indicate that we align ourselves with the democratic principle.

3.18.182
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
As I have already explained all these different points of view can be easily provided for under the clause,-- "Further provision governing Union citizenship may be made by the law of the Union."

3.18.183
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
All the difficulties suggested from various points of view can, be covered in this. It is open to the Union to make any law governing citizenship, if it is necessary. After all how many people are going outside? A few people. Supposing some children are born outside and if there is any such necessity, this proviso amply covers such difficulties. The difficulties on the opposite side also are covered. Therefore, our general preface or the general right of citizenship under these fundamental rights should be so broad-based that any one who reads our laws cannot take any other view than that we have taken an enlightened modern civilised view. The citizenship clause has been taken from the American model which is more or less consistent with the English. And therefore we should not disturb this and we need not be frightened about it because it is not going to create any difficulties in the intervening period of ten years. If we find any difficulties after our experience of the working of the Constitution for ten years one can easily change it. But I have no doubt that there is going to be no intricacy or difficulty. It is a simple clause which will be fit and proper for the first Constitution of free India, and we need not have any suspicions.

3.18.184
C. Rajagopalachariar
Sir, I think it should be "further provisions". It must be plural and not singular.

3.18.185
President
Even after listening to the learned discourses that have been given to us by eminent lawyers, I confess that I am not yet convinced that the clause as it is, has been rightly put. But it is of course open to the House to accept it in this form.

3.18.186
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
Sir, I suggest that the consideration of this clause may be further postponed.

3.18.187
President
I am afraid that is not possible. The words-- "Further provisions governing Indian citizenship may be made by the law of the Union." would not improve matters, because "further" means in addition to and not in modification of. Therefore, that would not in any way take away from the amplitude of the clause as it is in the first part of it. But, as I have said, I do not like to influence the House beyond expressing my own opinion, and I leave it to you to give your vote.

3.18.187
Unamed Members
The clause may be held over.

3.18.188
C. Rajagopalachariar
Sir, will you permit me to say a word? There is some misunderstanding.

3.18.189
President
I do not think it would be right at this stage to allow any member to speak on this clause. There is a suggestion which seems to come from many members that the consideration of this clause may be postponed. The question is: "That the consideration of this clause be postponed."

(Votes were taken by show of hands). The motion was adopted.


3.18.190
President
I will particularly request lawyers and jurists who are members of this House to give their attention to this clause and to give us something which will be acceptable to all. If they too feel that the clause as it stands should be accepted, I have no doubt that the House will accept their opinion with the respect which is due to them.

3.18.191
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar
Sir, we have a big Committee and it is an unworkable proposition for twenty people to discuss the question of citizenship. The whole point has been discussed and I suggest that a small Committee may be appointed to consider this clause.

3.18.192
K.M. Munshi
That will be better; they can meet and have a discussion because this is a purely technical discussion.

3.18.193
President
This is a purely legal matter and, therefore, I should like to leave it to the lawyers to give us a draft.

3.18.194
K.M. Munshi
Three Committees have discussed this question thread-bare and you can now nominate any persons you like and they can discuss it with you.

3.18.195
President
It is not as if I alone am not convinced about it but a great part of the House is doubtful about this. So there is no use discussing with me alone; even if I am convinced and if the House is not convinced that would not take matters very far.

3.18.196
R. V. Dhulekar
Sir, I propose that a small Committee consisting of Sir B. L. Mitter, Dr. Katju and Mr. K. M. Munshi be appointed to go into this.

3.18.197
Jawaharlal Nehru
I think it should be left to the President and the Chairman of the Committee.

3.18.198
President
If it is left to me I will ask the lawyers to go into it.

3.18.199
B. Pattabhi Sitaramayya
I suggest that in addition to three lawyers one man of common sense may also be added.

3.18.200
President
I do not exclude lawyers from the category of people with common sense.

CLAUSE 4--RIGHTS OF EQUALITY


3.18.201
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, I beg to move clause 4 which runs as follows:
"4. (1) The State shall make no discrimination against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste or sex.
(2) There shall be no discrimination against any citizen on any ground of religion, race, caste or sex in regard to-
(a) access to trading establishments including public restaurants and hotels;
(b) the use of wells, tanks, roads and places of public resorts maintained wholly or partly out of public funds or dedicated to the use of the general public:
Provided that nothing contained in this clause shall prevent separate provision being made for women and children."

3.18.202
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
This is a non-discriminatory clause which is provided in almost all constitutions and adjustments have been made here to suit the special conditions of our country. There may be various points of view and in the Committee also there was a full discussion on this question and I am sure there will be discussion in this House also. A proviso has been made which was found to be necessary because even in a non-discriminatory clause it would be necessary in the present condition of our country to make special provision for women and children.

3.18.203
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Some amendments have been given notice of to remove doubts. In clause (2) (a) the words "and places of public entertainment" were suggested in the course of discussion to be added; and in clause 2(b), the words "State funds" are sought to be substituted for "public funds", Public funds may be by subscriptions or private arrangements; the clause is meant to apply to State funds. In clause (1) it is suggested that for "make no discrimination" the words "not discriminate" should be substituted. I shall accept these amendments when they are formally moved.

3.18.204
Purshottam Das Tandon
Is Sardar Patel himself putting forward these amendments?

3.18.205
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
I said that when these are formally moved I shall be prepared to accept them.

3.18.206
Mahavir Tyagi
May I know one thing from the Hon'ble the mover ? May I know why he thought it necessary to repeat in sub-clause (2) what he has already said in subclause (1)-I mean the words-- "There shall be no discrimination against any citizen on any ground of religion. race, caste or sex...."

3.18.207
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
It is very simple. The first clause is about the State obligation; the second clause deals with many matters which have nothing to do with the State, such as public restaurants--they are not run by States; and hotel--they are not run by State. It is an entirely different idea, and therefore, it is absolutely essential.

3.18.208
Mahavir Tyagi
It does not satisfy me. The second clause pertains to hotels and restaurants. To say that restaurants and hotels shall do this or that and there shall be no discrimination against any citizen on any ground of religion, race, caste or sex in regard to access to trading establishments including public restaurants and hotels, is including such establishments which are not included in the State. It is their outlook. But if we are also to enact for those which are not included in the State, then we should make it clear. Could we not put it in one clause that no discrimination shall be allowed against any citizen in regard to restaurants, hotels, well, tanks, roads, and so on? The clause as it stands does not mean this. Either the language should be slightly different, or perhaps I have not exactly followed the meaning of this clause.

3.18.209
R. K. Sidhva
The words 'Hotels and public restaurants' have been mentioned for special reasons and specific purposes. They are used by the public and even at present licence from the local bodies is necessary before they are allowed to function. It is very necessary that these public places of entertainment--hotels, and restaurants--should be specifically mentioned, so that the owners may not say that A shall be allowed and B shall not be allowed. These words have a definite and special meaning, and they are absolutely necessary. I, therefore strongly suggest that the words be retained as the Hon'ble Sardar Patel has moved.

3.18.210
K.M. Munshi
Mr. President, Sir, I move: 1. "That in clause 4 (1) the words 'not discriminate' may be substituted in place of 'make no discrimination'." It is merely a matter of phraseology.
2. "That in clause 4, sub-clause (2) (a) the following words may be added: 'and places of public entertainment'."

3.18.211
K.M. Munshi
A doubt was raised whether places of public entertainment could be treated as trading establishments. In order to make it clear that places of public entertainment are trading establishments, this amendment has been moved: 3. "That in clause 4, sub-clause (2) (b) substitute the words 'State funds' for public funds'." "Public funds" might be construed differently; it may be even money raised by public subscription for specific purpose. This amendment will clear this doubt.


3.18.212
President
We have received notice of a number of other amendments to this clause.

3.18.213
P. S. Deshmukh
May I say a word as a matter of general observation on this clause'? In drafting such a long clause we are throwing a shadow of untouchability over the whole Constitution of India. In this particular clause, I submit to the House, if we merely say that-- "the State shall not permit any discrimination against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste or sex."

3.18.214
P. S. Deshmukh
It should be quite sufficient, and it will leave ample opportunity to the Union Government to make specific provisions with regard to hotels, restaurants, parks, theatres, etc. I think, therefore, that the whole of the second part should be omitted. We should not forget that we have to confine ourselves to the rights which are and must be fundamental. This is not the place to enumerate all the various rights a citizen should have. We are here concerned with only justiciable fundamental rights and it would be improper to burden the clauses with a detailed list of places which should be accessible to all. I, therefore, suggest, Sir, that it will serve our purpose if we merely substitute in the place of the whole clause the following-- "That the State shall not make nor permit any discrimination against any citizen, on mere grounds of religion, race, caste or sex."

3.18.215
Somnath Lahiri
Sir, I support the original motion but there should not be any discrimination on the ground of political creed. The whole idea of these clauses is that discrimination should not be exercised by the State or by other public bodies in respect of religion, caste etc. In the unnatural circumstances of today in India, religious, communal, caste and similar distinctions loom large. But when things have settled down political differences are sure to come to the forefront and there may be a tendency on the part of the State or public bodies to discriminate against members of political parties on the basis of difference in political creeds. In every country in the world you will find that measures are taken generally to obviate this kind of discrimination on the ground of political creed or party. Therefore I want to move: "That in sub-clause (1) of clause 4, after the words 'grounds of', the words 'political creed' be inserted." Similarly, I beg to move: "That in sub-clause 2 of clause 4, after the word 'caste' the word 'creed be inserted." I support also Mr. Kamath's amendment to the same sub-clauses of clause 4.

3.18.216
President
Have you moved both the amendments?

3.18.217
Somnath Lahiri
I have moved both the amendments, Sir.

3.18.218
H. V. Kamath
Sir, in moving this amendment I seek to draw a distinction between religion and creed. I think the word religion is not comprehensive enough to include in its scope creed as well. For instance, a person may not accept any religion in the conventional or formal sense of the term, yet he may have a creed. A man may say that he has no religion, yet he may say that he is a rationalist or a free-thinker and that I suppose is a creed which anybody can profess and still he may say that he does not belong to the Hindu, Muslim or Sikh religion, or for the matter of that to any other religion. Therefore, I think that the word creed should be inserted in this clause.

3.18.219
H. V. Kamath
I do not subscribe to my friend Mr. Lahiri's suggestion regarding political creed. I do recognise that times may arise when we may have to discriminate against persons who hold a creed which seeks to subvert the State by violence or similar objectionable methods. We may have to impose discrimination against such persons. But I submit that the word 'creed' has a different connotation from the words 'political creed'.

3.18.220
H. V. Kamath
As regards 'colour' perhaps it is included in the word 'race'. Yet I have my own doubts on that point as well. Personally, I do not think that the word 'race' should find a place here, as that would mean that we recognise a multiplicity of races in India--a doctrine to which I do not subscribe. Yet if ethnologists who are present here think that there are many races in India and the word 'race' must be there, I will yield to them on that point. But I think in that case the word colour should find a place in this clause.

3.18.221
Unnamed Member
What do you mean by colour?

'Colour' means colour of your complexion. Two persons may belong to the same race but may have different colours physically. Therefore to make it comprehensive I move: "That in sub-clause (1) and (2) of clause 4, after the word 'caste' the words 'colour, creed' be inserted."

3.18.223
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
Sir, I beg to move: "That in sub-clause (2) of clause 4, after the word "sex', the following words be inserted:  'or of dress worn by any nationality'."

3.18.224
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
It seems almost a laughing matter. But even today when we are on the threshold of independence there are hotels which do not welcome people dressed in Indian style. I know of an instance which recently occurred when four Indian gentlemen of my province were not allowed to live in a hotel because they wore Indian dress. I am not afraid that in future the same restriction will be observed by any hotel owners. Today of course unfortunately there are some European-owned or European-managed hotels which do not take in Indians in Indian dress or make it a condition that they must not come to their dining rooms in that dress. I am not afraid of the future, because I believe that when India is independent such restriction would disappear. But what I am afraid of is a reprisal or a revenge taken against such European minded people and people in European dress may not be allowed to come into hotels. For that reason particularly I want that this amendment should be accepted by this House.

3.18.225
D. N. Datta
Sir, I do not want to move the amendment which stands in my name. (Amendment No. 12 on Supplementary List, dated 28th April 1947).

3.18.226
D. Govinda Doss
(Spoke in Telugu) Sir, I move: "That in sub-clause 2 (b) of clause 4, after the word 'roads' the words 'Schools, temples or places of worship' be inserted."

3.18.227
V. C. Kesava Rao
"That in sub-clause 2 (b) of clause 4, after the word 'roads' the words 'Schools, hostels, temples or places of worship' be inserted."

3.18.228
V. C. Kesava Rao
I want to say that though some schools are thrown open to the Harijans in the villages, they are not allowed to sit along with the caste Hindu students. They are asked to sit on the floor or at a distance. I would like to say in this connection that education is the birth-right of every citizen. So a Harijan or an untouchable should be given the same right as every other citizen. As regards temples, I may submit that untouchables are made to worship God only from a distance and not before God. Even though the untouchables are saying that they are Hindus for the last so many centuries, they are being denied this right and they are made to worship God only from a distance and not within the temple itself. I think that untouchability is the sole cause for the non-admission of untouchables into temples. I request that these things may be taken into consideration.

3.18.229
President
There is another amendment in the name of Shri P. Kakkan. But that is covered by the amendments that have already been moved by Mr. Govinda Doss and Mr. Kesava Rao, and it is not necessary to move that amendment (that is, amendment No. 15).

3.18.230
Ajit Prasad Jain
I beg to move: "That in sub-clause (2) (b) of clause 4, after the word 'roads' the words 'educational institution, hospital or dispensary', be inserted; and after the word 'resort' the words 'built or' be inserted."

3.18.231
Ajit Prasad Jain
The speaker who preceded me just now has spoken about educational institutions. It is not necessary for me to repeat those arguments. I have also included hospitals and dispensaries among the places in regard to which no discrimination should be made provided they receive aid from State funds. Educational institutions, dispensaries and hospitals are very necessary for the moral, mental and physical, development and my opinion is that any public institution which receives any assistance from State funds should he open to all persons irrespective of their religion, caste, race or sex. In this connection, I would like to refer to paragraph 18 (3) (b) which says: "The State shall not, while providing State aid to schools, discriminate against schools under the management of minorities whether based on religion, community or language."

3.18.232
Ajit Prasad Jain
Now, the amendment which I have suggested would negative this provision, for I would make it compulsory that any educational institution, hospital or dispensary, if it receives any aid or assistance should be thrown open to all persons. Secondly, I want the words "built or" to be inserted after the word "resort", for the States assistance may take the form of a lump sum or a periodical amount for the purpose of maintaining the thing. The present clause as it stands will not include institutions which receive any lump sum aid for construction and, therefore, my second suggestion is that the words "built or" be inserted after the word "resort", so that both the institutions which have been built or are maintained by the State funds may come within the mischief of this clause.

3.18.233
R. R. Diwakar
I beg to move: "That in sub-clause (2) (b) of clause 4 for the word 'and' a comma be substituted, and after the word 'resort', the following words be inserted:--     and schools, colleges and other institutions."

3.18.234
R. R. Diwakar
I should like to bring to the notice of the House that this is a question of equal opportunity. Equal opportunity to all should be given in schools, colleges and other institutions which are State-aided, so that people may not be shut out from any institution on account of race, creed, religion, etc. There may be some apprehension that if this amendment is accepted certain schools which are denominational or run by certain sections or communities may be flooded, or entry may be demanded by all into such schools. But I may state that there is a sufficient safeguard in the phrase which says, "dedicated to the use of the general public". Unless the institutions are run wholly or partly by State funds and are dedicated to the use of the general public, there is no such danger arising by the acceptance of this amendment. Therefore, I request the House to accept it.

3.18.235
R. R. Diwakar
I also move:"That after the words 'general public' at the end of sub-clause (2) (b) of clause 4, the following be added: -- 'and (c) the use of all kinds of public conveyances'." I do not think it necessary for me to say anything about it.

3.18.236
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
I beg to move: "That the following explanation be added at the end of clause 4:-- 'Explanation: A place of public resort includes a yard or house attached to any temple where musical and dramatic performances, cinema shows or other entertainments are held for entertainment of general public'."


3.18.237
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
There are many temples which have got attached to them houses called Nat Mandirs. During festivals and on other occasions also dramatic performances and cinema shows are held there. The performances are sometimes given by people belonging to what you call the Harijans, but the Harijans themselves are not allowed to go. This is very galling to the people. Therefore, whenever any show or any dramatic performance takes place in any place attached to the temple, all members of the public must have access to it.

3.18.238
President
Have you a new clause to be added, or is it an amendment to clause 4?

3.18.239
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
It has been misplaced, or wrongly placed. It should be under clause 6 as an amendment.

3.18.240
President
You can take it up with clause 6.

3.18.241
President
Now all the amendments of which notice was given have been moved. Therefore, the motion as well as the amendments are now open for discussion.

3.18.242
K.M. Munshi
Sir, regarding adding the words "schools, etc." to clause 4, I submit that this matter be left over till we come to clause 18. Otherwise the discussion on clause 4 will drift to other matters which are connected to this subject. If it becomes necessary as a result of discussion, to make some modification in clause 4, that may be made later. The discussion will be more cognate so far as education is concerned, if it is taken up with clause 18.

3.18.243
K.M. Munshi
As regards the amendments relating to temples, they relate to untouchability and I submit that they should be taken up with clause 6. This particular clause -- clause 4, relates only to rights of citizens with regard to places of public use.

3.18.244
K.M. Munshi
I, therefore, submit that permission may be given to members to deal with these amendments under clause 18 and clause 6.

3.18.245
R. R. Diwakar
In view of the suggestion by Shri Munshi, I hold over my amendment regarding schools.

3.18.246
M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar
I would like to submit that there are sources of water supply other than wells, tanks, etc., such as channels, and I think these also should be covered by clause No. 4. Therefore, I think it necessary to add the words "and other sources of water supply" after the word "tank". Otherwise, there will be a lacuna.

3.18.247
M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar
Then again, there may be discrimination in giving medical relief, on grounds of religion, etc. That will be a dangerous thing. Therefore, Sir, if you do not think want of notice a serious objection against it, I would request you to permit me to add the words "and medical institutions" after the word "public resort". It will then read:- "the use of wells, tanks, roads and places of public resort and medical institutions maintained wholly or partly out of public funds or dedicated to the use of the general public."

3.18.248
R. K. Sidhva
I want to have one point clarified, Sir. Suppose a well is constructed by a philanthropic person at a public place in a small village, but he has not dedicated it for public use, and allows everyone to use it, except a few persons in the village, he has used a public place but not dedicated for public use, what will happen? What will be the position then? As it is, this clause is not happily worded, and the House might like to have it worded in a better way.

3.18.249
President
I would request the mover to give his reply now.

3.18.250
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
The first amendment is from Mr. Somnath Lahiri. He wants that there should be no discrimination on grounds of political creed. I do not know what discrimination he has in view. The non-discrimination clause is restricted to, or is provided for on grounds of religion, race, caste or sex. He wants 'political creed' also to be included. I think it is an absurd idea to provide for non-discrimination as regards a political creed. Political creed may be of any kind. There may be some political creeds highly objectionable. Some may not be deserving of discrimination, but may actually be deserving of suppression altogether. So, I think it does not fit in here. The other amendment relates to colour. I do not know what is the meaning of it. There are different kinds of colours among Indians themselves. Have we got to provide for all of them. Therefore, I do not think all these amendments are necessary at all. The amendment relating to schools and colleges can be provided for when we come to discuss a separate clause relating thereto.

3.18.251
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
I am glad that on the whole the House is of opinion that this clause is aptly drafted.

3.18.252
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Now there is only amendment left of Srijut Rohini Kumar Chaudhury. I do not think this is really necessary. There is no bar against any particular kind of dress. In my present dress I go to the Viceroy's house as well as to the abode of the humblest peasant. There is now no discrimination on account of dress.

3.18.253
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
In some hotels and restaurants there is ban against the entry of Indians dressed in Indian national costume.

3.18.254
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
All the foreigners are going. You need not be obsessed on that account. Such things as dress cannot be put in the fundamental rights. If the world at large should read such provisions in our fundamental rights, then they would naturally conclude that we do not even know how to treat our nationals and how to treat our fellow beings. I may assure my friend that there is no discrimination now on account of dress. I do not think such things should be provided for in fundamental rights.

3.18.255
Rohini Kumar Chaudhury
What about the ban of entry of Indians in some hotels and restaurants because of their dress?

3.18.256
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
The whole conception is born out of the idea of slavery. That idea of slavery has been haunting some of our people. Not even a shadow of it is left now.

3.18.257
President
Mr. Deshmukh has suggested that it would be sufficient if you put one clause as follows: "The State shall not make or permit any discrimination merely on the ground of religion, etc:........"

3.18.258
President
The idea is if you put it like that, that would cover all cases and the second sub-clause will not be necessary. It would cover cases of private institutions as well as State institutions. We can have one comprehensive clause.

3.18.259
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
If there is no formal amendment, I should prefer the present clause to stand as it is.

3.18.279
President
The question is that clause 4, as amended, be passed. The motion was adopted.

CLAUSE 6


3.18.280
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Sir, I request that clause 5 may be held over because it requires some further consideration and I may be allowed to move clause 6 which runs thus: "6. 'Untouchability' in any form is abolished and the imposition of any disability on that account shall be an offence."

3.18.281
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
There can be no difference of opinion on this question. This is now an accepted proposition all over and should be provided for in the fundamental rights, and anyone who suffers a disability on this account should have the right to go to a court of law and have redress. I hope there will be no amendment on this.


3.18.282
H. V. Kamath
Sir, I move that in clause 6, after the word "Untouchability" the word "unapproachability" be inserted, and after the word "any" the words "and every" be inserted.

3.18.283
H. V. Kamath
By this amendment I want to make the clause more comprehensive because in some parts of India the practice of unapproachability besides untouchability used to obtain some years ago, to my own knowledge, in some places like Malabar specially; I do not know what it is now. So I though it that if you include the word "unapproachability" it would make the clause more comprehensive. The other small amendment that I propose is purely verbal. It does not change the meaning but only emphasises the clause.

3.18.284
S. Nagappa
Sir, I move that in clause 6, for the words "imposition of any disability", the words "observance of any disability" be substituted. My reason is that imposition implies that one party that imposes it on another is guilty but I suggest that if the untouchability is observed by any person it must be an offence. Unless this amendment is made I do not think the provision made here is enough to punish a person. So I request the House to see that by accepting my amendment observance of untouchability is made a punishable offence.

3.18.285
P. Kunhiraman
Sir, I move that in clause 6 after the word "offence" the following words be inserted: "punishable by law."

3.18.286
P. Kunhiraman
The original clause makes it an offence and implies that it will be punishable; I want to make it more explicit. It is just a verbal amendment and I commend it for acceptance. Moreover, if we only say that it is an offence it may be interpreted later on in the sense that it is not a legal offence. So it is necessary that it should be made explicit.

3.18.287
President
The motion and the amendments are now under discussion.

3.18.288
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
The first amendment is by Mr. Kamath. He wants the addition of the word 'unapproachability'. If untouchability is provided for in the fundamental rights as an offence, all necessary adjustments will be made in the law that may be passed by the Legislature. I do not think it is right or wise to provide for such necessary corollaries and, therefore, I do not accept this amendment.

3.18.289
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
The other amendment is by Mr. Nagappa who has suggested that for the words "imposition of any disability'' the words "observance of any disability'' may be substituted. I cannot understand his point. I can observe one man imposing a disability on another, and I will be guilty I have observed it. I do not think such extreme things should be provided for. The removal of untouchability is the main idea, and if untouchability is made illegal or an offence, it is quite enough.

3.18.290
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
The next amendment was moved by Mr. Kunhiraman. He has suggested the insertion of 'punishable by law'. We have provided that imposition of untouchability shall be an offence. Perhaps his idea is that an offence could be excusable, or sometimes an offence may be rewarded. Offence is an offence; it is not necessary to provide that offence should be punishable by law. Sir, I do not accept this amendment either.

3.18.291
Vallabhbhai J. Patel
Then, it was proposed that for the words 'any form', the words 'all forms' be substituted. Untouchability in any form is a legal phraseology, and no more addition is necessary.

3.18.292
H. V. Kamath
In view of the explanation given by the Hon'ble Sardar Patel I beg leave of the House to withdraw the amendments moved by me. The amendments were, by leave of the Assembly, withdrawn.

3.18.293
President
The question is: "That in clause 6, for the words 'imposition of any disability', the words observance of any disability' be substituted." The motion was negatived.

3.18.294
P. Kunhiraman
Sir, in the light of the observations made by the Mover of the Resolution I beg leave of the House to withdraw the amendment moved by me. The amendment was, by leave of the Assembly, withdrawn.

3.18.295
President
The question is that clause 6 be accepted. The motion was adopted.

3.18.296
President
I have received a request from several Members that they should be permitted to give notice of amendments to the clauses which have not yet been considered, and their ground is that yesterday they received the Report rather late and they could not send in their amendments before 5 o'clock. We have already got a large number of amendments, and I do not know if the House would like to extend the time to receive more.

3.18.297
Mahavir Tyagi
It does not matter because your disposal is so fast.

3.18.298
President
It is not my disposal, but it is done by the House.

3.18.299
President
If we get the amendments up to 5 o'clock then there is this difficulty. The amendments have to be tabulated, typed and cyclostyled, and there is very little time in the evening because of the Curfew Order. On previous occasions they had to work up to late at night. Now they find it difficult to work at night. If, the Members waive their right of getting copies of these amendments, I might accept their request.

3.18.300
Rai Bahadur Syamanandan Sahaya
They may be amendments which were received in office after 5 o'clock yesterday.

3.18.301
President
Those which have already been received will be accepted and even today if notice of amendments is received up to 2 o'clock they will be taken in. But after that it will be very difficult. In any case, amendments to amendments can be handed in until the Session begins tomorrow morning.

3.18.302
President
As regards the time, we met at half past 8 o'clock today and we have carried on for 4 hours. But I am told that time is not convenient to, some Members, and it is still more inconvenient to our Office people, some of whom live in distant parts of the city. They have to work from 8 o'clock in the morning to late in the evening. If the House agrees we might meet at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

Yes, yes.


3.18.304
President
The House now stands adjourned.

The Assembly then adjourned till Nine of the Clock on Wednesday, the 30th April 1947.
